# Changelog for matter.js

This page shows a detailed overview of the changes between versions without the need to look into code, especially to see relevant changes while interfaces and features are still in flux.

The main work (all changes without a GitHub username in brackets in the below list) is done by the core team of this project completely in their free time (see their individual profiles for sponsoring options): @Apollon77 and @lauckhart

## __WORK IN PROGRESS__

- @matter/testing
    - Breaking: `BackchannelCommand.SimulateLongPress` carries the switch's `featureMap`, which a chip test app requires to decide which events a press produces
    - Enhancement: Chip certification test devices take simulation commands through the named pipe their app opens, so a step that operates the device runs against a chip app rather than skipping
    - Enhancement: A certification step subscribing to events may ask for them urgently via `SubscribeEventOptions.urgent`, so a device reports them as they occur rather than at the subscription's maximum interval
    - Enhancement: A certification test requests a transport preference for its controllers via `certTest`'s `transport` option; `"tcp"` asks for a TCP-backed session where the peer supports one, and adapters receive the request through `ControllerAdapterOptions`
    - Enhancement: A certification step whose check could not be evaluated ends `"unverified"` and fails the run, unless the check states why the claim cannot be observed
    - Enhancement: Per-step certification PICS is evaluated on chip device flavors too, and `result.json` reports how many steps their PICS excluded
    - Fix: A certification run's `result.json` no longer reports a passing verdict for a run that failed
    - Fix: A failure to attach a certification run's device logs fails the run instead of only warning

- @matter/model
    - Enhancement: `DeviceTypeModel.effectiveComposition` states whether a device type composes its endpoint's `PartsList` of every descendant or of its own children

- @matter/node
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer` reserves credential index 0 for the programming PIN, refusing it for any other credential type and refusing any other index for the programming PIN. The programming PIN counts as one credential rather than one of the PIN credentials, and reports no next index
    - Fix: (@Luligu) Corrects status codes returned by `DoorLockServer.setCredential` for duplicating another credential of the same type and adding an occupied credential index
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer.setCredential` creates the user alongside the credential when the request carries no user index
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer.setCredential` reports `NextCredentialIndex` on a failing response as well as a successful one
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer.setCredential` reports `OCCUPIED` when no user slot remains for a new credential
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer.setCredential` answers `INVALID_COMMAND` when the user fields a request carries do not match the use case it states
    - Fix: `DoorLockServer` stores each enumerated field of a user or credential record as its Matter enumeration, so a value the enumeration does not define is refused rather than kept
    - Fix: A bridged node's `PartsList` names its own children rather than every endpoint below it
    - Fix: A constraint that bounds an enumerated value to named values of its own type, such as the `add, modify` of a door lock's operation type, is now applied. A cluster that refuses a payload it cannot validate, as `DoorLock` does, answers a client naming another value with `INVALID_COMMAND` instead of acting on it
    - Fix: Creating a struct fills in a default only for a field the cluster supports, so a field a device does not set stays absent instead of carrying the fallback its schema states. A write of a list entry that omits a feature-gated field is accepted, where it previously failed validation against the field it had filled in. Affects `Thermostat` preset names and setpoints, `Descriptor` tag labels, `MediaPlayback` track attributes and the feature-gated members of `ClosureControl`, `ClosureDimension`, `ElectricalEnergyMeasurement`, `CommodityPrice` and `CommodityTariff`
    - Fix: A struct field's default is stored in the units and shape of its datatype: a preset created without a cooling setpoint reads `2600` rather than the schema's `26°C` notation, and a bitmap default arrives decoded
    - Fix: Each struct created by a write receives its own copy of a list or bitmap default instead of sharing one instance
    - Fix: A nullable field the active features make mandatory holds `null` when a write omits it, where a field made mandatory by a feature expression previously stayed absent
    - Fix: A write that names an inherited property, such as `__proto__` or `toString`, is refused like any other property the cluster does not declare; `__proto__` previously replaced the prototype of the value being written
    - Fix: `ClientStructure.applyWireChanges` applies the change it is given. A client node keys each member of a cluster by attribute ID, and a change from the remote API addresses members by property name, so values landed under a key reads were never served from: the update was invisible and never persisted. Values now convert as the change is applied
    - Fix: `ClientStructure.applyWireChanges` regenerates a behavior whose cluster definition changed and prunes attributes the cluster dropped, as the Matter protocol path already did
    - Fix: Validation honors the conformance and quality an element inherits, so an element overridden by an operational extension is no longer judged as if it stated neither
    - Fix: A write from local code that adds an entry to a fabric-scoped list without a `fabricIndex` now fails validation instead of storing an entry that belongs to no fabric. Writes from a peer are unaffected — the accessing fabric is supplied for them
    - Fix: Assigning a whole list to a fabric-scoped attribute that held none merges through the managed list, so its entries are fabric-filtered and carry the accessing fabric; it previously bypassed both
    - Fix: A `ConformanceError` names the conformance the decision was made on rather than the element's own
    - Fix: A mandatory command a cluster leaves unimplemented is no longer dispatched; an invoke answers `UNSUPPORTED_COMMAND`, matching what the cluster advertises in `AcceptedCommandList`
    - Fix: A discovered peer cluster records the `ClusterRevision` the peer reports rather than the standard cluster's, and peers differing only in revision no longer share a behavior

- @matter/types
    - Fix: A `status` field in a cluster that defines its own status codes is now `Status | <Cluster>.StatusCode`, so producing a cluster-specific code needs no cast and consuming one needs narrowing. This affects `DoorLock.SetCredentialResponse` and the DoorLock schedule responses

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: A group message's log line names the port beside the multicast address it went to, in the usual IPv6 form (`dest: [ff35:40:…]:5540`)
    - Fix: A command whose payload does not match the command's schema is answered with `INVALID_COMMAND` instead of `FAILURE`
    - Fix: `UpdateFabricLabel` accepts an empty label, as the specification's `max 32` constraint sets no minimum; it previously failed the command
    - Enhancement: An interaction can be abandoned by the caller: `ClientRequest.abort` takes an `AbortSignal`, honored for read, write, invoke and subscribe
    - Fix: An error escaping a command handler with no defined status code answers that command with `FAILURE` inside the `InvokeResponse` instead of terminating the message with a status response, so the other commands of a batch invoke keep their results. Under `SuppressResponse` such a command now sends no response at all, as for any other generated status
    - Fix: A device that returns an empty or malformed DAC, PAI, attestation elements or Certification Declaration during commissioning now fails attestation with a finding that names the unreadable field, instead of an opaque decoder message
    - Fix: A certificate extension matter.js does not interpret is no longer decoded, so a proprietary extension can no longer fail the whole certificate; an extension matter.js does read is rejected with a `CertificateError` when its value is missing

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Enhancement: `InteractionClient`'s read, write, invoke and subscribe options take an `abort` signal, forwarded to the interaction

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `deepCopy` copies a `Date` as a `Date` rather than an empty object
    - Fix: A log destination that throws no longer propagates the failure into the code that logged; the remaining destinations still receive the message and the broken destination is reported once
    - Fix: `DataReader` throws `DataReadError` when a read would pass the end of the buffer; `readByteArray` and `readUtf8String` no longer return short data
    - Fix: `DerCodec.decode` reports truncated input as `DerError` instead of a `RangeError`, and rejects a length that overflows or uses the indefinite-length encoding instead of decoding a value as present and empty
    - Fix: One unreadable record in an mDNS message no longer discards the whole message
    - Enhancement: `Transaction.lock()` takes an exclusive lock on resources without a promise where they are free, and waits instead of throwing where another transaction holds them
    - Breaking: `DnssdNames.Context.goodbyeProtectionWindow` and `DnssdNames.defaults.goodbyeProtectionWindow` are now `evictionDelay`, and `DnssdName.deleteRecord` no longer takes an `ifOlderThan` argument
    - Enhancement: New `MatterAggregateError.settleSeries()` runs tasks in order, continuing past a failure, and reports the accumulated errors
    - Enhancement: A storage driver states how long a consumer may buffer dirty values via `StorageDriver.writeCoalescingInterval`, defaulting to 20 minutes; `MemoryStorageDriver` reports `Instant`
    - Enhancement: `Transaction.Participant` gains `settled()`, invoked once after every participant's pre-commit reports no further mutation and before any of them writes; throwing there rejects the commit, and writes and further participants are refused while it runs
    - Enhancement: `Transaction.Participant` gains `conclusion(outcome)`, which runs once per commit cycle or rollback — including the commit phase two failure that skips both `postCommit` and `rollback` — and states whether the transaction committed, rolled back, or ended inconsistent; it runs with the transaction's locks released and further writes refused
    - Fix: A post-commit handler that rejects no longer detaches the remaining participants' post-commit work from the transaction
    - Adjustment: `postCommit` and the new `conclusion` reach the participants commit phase two dispatched, so a participant that joins while its values are written — as a store does — is now told the outcome; one that joins after phase two has passed it is not, having run no phase at all
    - Adjustment: A rollback completes once its participants have been told the outcome; where a participant reports asynchronously, a rollback that failed now rejects instead of throwing synchronously
    - Fix: Opening a namespace whose `driver.json` names an unregistered storage driver now throws `NoProviderError` instead of silently opening the existing data with a mismatched driver
    - Fix: DNS-SD ignores SRV records with port 0, an empty target or an out-of-range port
    - Fix: DNS-SD honors a goodbye that arrives shortly after the same record was re-announced
    - Fix: DNS-SD honors the mDNS cache-flush bit
    - Fix: DNS-SD resolution queries A/AAAA for the SRV target host instead of the service instance name
    - Fix: The `Symbol.metadata` polyfill no longer conflicts with `lib.esnext.decorators` in the published declarations

- @matter/model
    - Fix: A constraint that names a bound held by another element, written `<Element>.<Field>`, now applies that bound instead of accepting every value. This enforces `OccupancySensing.HoldTime`, `AmbientContextSensing.HoldTime` and `SoilMeasurement.SoilMoistureMeasuredValue` against their declared limits, on client writes, on assignment and on the stored value at startup
    - Fix: A constraint that bounds a value to named values of its own enumeration, such as the `add, modify` of a door lock's operation type, states those values rather than names that resolve to nothing, so `EncodedConstraint()` now reports the bound the specification states. Validating such a field does not yet apply the bound
    - Enhancement: Model validation reports a constraint that names an element which does not resolve, since such a bound is silently skipped and the value accepted unchecked
    - Fix: A constraint of `any` or `MS`, neither of which the constraint language defines, states no bound rather than a bound naming a value that does not exist, and the fields that carried one no longer state a constraint at all
    - Fix: `JointFabricDatastore.DatastoreAccessControlEntryStruct` states its `Subjects` and `Targets` as unbounded; they were bounded by attributes of the `AccessControl` cluster, which a constraint cannot reach, so the bound never applied
    - Enhancement: `StoredDefaultValue()` states the default a value store holds for a member, beside the existing `SelectDefaultValue()` and `MandatoryDefaultValue()`
    - Fix: Conformance applicability reports a term that compares a value as conditional rather than optional, so an element the record's own contents decide is no longer treated as mandatory when the features around the comparison are supported
    - Enhancement: `ClusterModel.statusCodes` gives the cluster's own status code definition, inherited by a derived cluster like the other member accessors
    - Fix: TemperatureMeasurement's MinMeasuredValue and MaxMeasuredValue now default to `null` ("range unavailable"), like the other measurement clusters, instead of -27315 and 32767, and carry the constraints the specification states rather than hand-written ones
    - Fix: A device type requiring several instances of one component, such as `BatteryStorage` with two electrical sensors and two power sources, no longer reports each instance as a duplicate of the others
    - Enhancement: The model build reports an instance number stated on a requirement other than a component device type, where the specification numbers nothing
    - Enhancement: A model element's `extend()` can remove an inherited quality, stated as `!N` in the quality definition; the removal survives further extension, and a definition that extends one carrying a removal may state the quality again
    - Fix: A quality definition given as an array of flags, such as `["N", "T"]`, loads those flags instead of reading as empty
    - Fix: A quality states which of its flags are not qualities, so a definition another rewrites still carries the flags it could not parse and the errors they raise
    - Fix: A value whose type derives from an enum, as a status code does, is judged by the integer type that holds it, so the numeric definition rules no longer skip it and a scene-capable attribute of such a type is no longer refused
    - Breaking: A provisional element is no longer mandatory; conformance following a `P` describes the conformance intended once the element leaves provisional state
    - Enhancement: `FeatureSelectionErrors()` assesses a cluster's selected features against the combinations its FeatureMap conformance disallows
    - Enhancement: `FeatureSet.resolve()` resolves a feature short code, title or camelized title to a short code
    - Enhancement: New `EncodedConstraint()` restates every bound of a constraint in the units the value is encoded in
    - Enhancement: New `EncodedConstraint.bounds()` reports which of a constraint's bounds state a number in encoding units and which state a unit with no known scale
    - Fix: The model build rejects a value stating a unit with no known scale, a fraction an integer type cannot hold, or a negative an unsigned type cannot hold
    - Fix: The model build rejects a bound or default stating a number outside the range of the integer type that carries it, such as the `300` of a `0 to 300` constraint on a `uint8`
    - Fix: The model build rejects a bound or default stating a magnitude beyond the range of the float type that carries it, such as the `1e300` of a `single`
    - Fix: A constraint bound keeps the magnitude it states: the parser accumulated digits as a number, so `max 18446744073709551615` became 18446744073709552000 and a `uint64` bound admitted values above the type. A bound a number cannot state exactly is now a bigint
    - Fix: A bitmap or enum value states its magnitude exactly, so a `map64` value no longer loses precision passing through `FieldValue.cast()`
    - Breaking: `FieldValue.numericValue()` returns a `bigint` for a magnitude a number cannot state exactly, so a 64 bit bound and default keep what they say. `FieldValue.countValue()` is the number-valued form, for a length, a bit position or a count
    - Fix: `Metatype.cast()` to a float reads a number stated as text instead of refusing it
    - Fix: A default stating a number no integer form matches, such as `1e-3`, is rejected instead of stored as the digits preceding the exponent
    - Fix: `FieldValue.cast()` treats "no value" as a value of every type, so an override removes a default rather than making the value invalid
    - Fix: A rejected default is reported as the value it states and the type that rejected it
    - Fix: `FieldValue.cast()` reads a duration, which it previously rejected whatever the value stated
    - Fix: `ValidateModel()` no longer writes a normalized default to a final model, which threw because a final model is frozen; it reports on such a model without normalizing it
    - Fix: A percentage on a type other than `percent` or `percent100ths` no longer resolves to the printed number as though it were already encoded
    - Fix: A constraint bound's unit takes its scale from the types the value derives from, not from its own type name alone
    - Enhancement: New `Scope.isMandatory()` tells whether a member is mandatory under a schema's supported features, and the new `MandatoryDefaultValue()` computes the value such a member assumes when no real value exists (schema default, else the specification's fallback value, recursing into structs) — the basis for what an unreported client node attribute reads, usable wherever schema-derived fallback values are needed; `SelectDefaultValue()` exposes the shallow variant used for server state seeding
    - Fix: A cluster's feature table no longer selects features; a feature the specification makes unconditionally mandatory is always selected
    - Fix: Feature selection records against `operationalIsSupported` so a feature's `default` conveys only the specification's fallback value
    - Fix: A feature mandated by any of several alternatives, such as `DoorLock.User`, is now reported as required
    - Fix: A feature conformance that is a bracketed disjunction, such as `[VDO | SNP]`, is illegal only when none of its alternatives is selected
    - Fix: A choice set whose members are gated on a conformance expression, such as `[!PA].a` or `[PS].b`, requires a selection only where the gate admits a member, and rejects a member the gate excludes
    - Fix: An entry of an otherwise conformance applies only where the entries preceding it do not, and a feature is disallowed where no entry applies
    - Fix: A choice set whose members are all provisional, such as the `Groupcast` and `AmbientContextSensing` feature sets, no longer requires a selection
    - Fix: A boolean whose specification default is `0` now defaults to false instead of true
    - Fix: A fractional temperature or percentage default keeps its fraction
    - Fix: The bits of a bitmap carry the conformance the specification states for them
    - Fix: An event of a derived cluster takes the priority of the event it derives from
    - Fix: A derived cluster's changes to the fields of an inherited struct now apply correctly
    - Fix: An element whose access states a privilege but neither read nor write, such as `JointFabricAdministrator.AdministratorFabricIndex`, is read-only (but formally Spec-incompliant)
    - Fix: A constraint that bounds a value by a field named like a constraint keyword, such as the `Min` of ClosureDimension's range structs, survives serialization

- @matter/node
    - Fix: `Stop` and `StopWithOnOff` set `RemainingTime` to zero and report it, including where the application manages transitions and stated an end time
    - Fix: `StopMoveStep` and `MoveColor` with both rates zero set Color Control's `RemainingTime` to zero and report it, and clear the end time stated where the application manages transitions. `StopMoveStep` leaves the remaining time alone while a color loop runs, since a color loop ends only on `ColorLoopSet`
    - Fix: A Color Control color mode switch no longer discards the promise from `stopAllColorMovement()`, so an asynchronous override of it completes before the color values are converted
    - Breaking: The `transitionEndTimeMs` state field on `LevelControlServer` and `ColorControlServer` is now `transitionEndTime`, a `Timestamp`; the value is unchanged but the name and type are not
    - Fix: `MoveToLevelWithOnOff`, `MoveWithOnOff` and `StepWithOnOff` build their options from the Options attribute and the request's mask and override, so `CoupleColorTempToLevel` couples color temperature to the level for them as it already did for `MoveToLevel`, `Move` and `Step`
    - Fix: `StopWithOnOff` stops a transition on a device that is off; the ExecuteIfOff option gates the commands without On/Off only
    - Fix: `MoveWithOnOff` and `StepWithOnOff` turn the device off when the level they reach is the minimum, and leave a device that is off alone when the level moves down
    - Fix: A level change that couples On/Off or color temperature waits for a transaction holding those clusters instead of failing
    - Behavior: `LevelControlServer.couple()` takes the target level as a third argument, which is what decides whether the device turns off; an override that omits it loses that decision
    - Breaking: Default server exports no longer inherit the features their base implementation enables internally.
        - `ColorControlServer`, `DoorLockServer`, `ElectricalEnergyMeasurementServer`, `LevelControlServer`, `ModeSelectServer`, `PowerSourceServer`, `PowerTopologyServer`, `SmokeCoAlarmServer`, `SwitchServer`, `ThermostatServer` and `WindowCoveringServer` now select no features. Select the features your device supports with `.with(...)` or use the DeviceType specific Requirement definitions of these clusters which automatically enable the needed features for the device type
        - `PowerSourceServer`, `PowerTopologyServer`, `SmokeCoAlarmServer`, `SwitchServer`, `ThermostatServer`, `WindowCoveringServer` and `ElectricalEnergyMeasurementServer` now require a selection to be added to an endpoint at all. The `DoorLockDevice`, `SpeakerDevice` and `ModeSelectDevice` device types alias these exports, so their clusters also select no features and advertise a different FeatureMap.
        - Verify the feature set of every device you compose. Persisted cluster state resets once for affected devices because it is keyed by feature selection
    - Breaking: `Discovery.Options.scannerFilter` is removed; state the transports to discover on with `discoveryCapabilities`
    - Breaking: `discoveryCapabilities` moved from `CommissioningClient.CommissioningOptions` to `Discovery.Options`; it reaches discovery through `ServerNode.peers.commission()` and `peers.discover()`, and never had an effect on `ClientNode.commission()`. Code that declares its commissioning options as `CommissioningClient.CommissioningOptions` and sets `discoveryCapabilities` no longer compiles - declare them as `CommissioningDiscovery.Options` instead
    - Breaking: A LongIdleTimeSupport ICD must select CheckInProtocolSupport and UserActiveModeTrigger
    - Breaking: A node that accepts more than one path per invoke must select the General Diagnostics DataModelTest feature
    - Breaking: An unreported client node attribute reads its schema default, else the specification's fallback value for its type, when the attribute is mandatory under the peer's supported features, and `undefined` otherwise — regardless of the peer's AttributeList (an enum attribute reads `undefined`, as the specification defines its fallback as manufacturer-specific). The value is a detached copy, so mutating a struct or list read from an unreported attribute does not write through
    - Breaking: Configured options, environment variables, and state-class field initializers no longer seed a client node's cluster state; the peer's reports are the only source of values
    - Breaking: Adding a server cluster to an endpoint fails when its selected features violate the conformance of its FeatureMap
    - Breaking: A local write or invoke rejects a bitmap bit whose conformance the cluster's selected features do not satisfy, wherever the bitmap appears — an attribute, a command field, a struct member or an event field. So `LevelControl.Options.ExecuteIfOff` (also as the `optionsMask` or `optionsOverride` of `MoveToLevel`, `Move`, `Step` and `Stop`) needs Lighting or OnOff, a `ColorControl.ColorCapabilities` bit needs its color feature, a `WindowCovering.ConfigStatus` position or encoder bit needs the matching position-aware feature, `Thermostat.RemoteSensing.Occupancy` needs Occupancy, a closure's latch control mode needs Latching, and a `Messages.MessageControl` bit needs its messaging feature. Only a bit the value sets is judged, only what the conformance decides without a record around it, and a write or invoke carrying a remote subject stays permissive
    - Breaking: Provisional elements are no longer implemented by default; supply a state value or use `ClusterBehavior.enable()` to implement one
    - Breaking: `SoftwareUpdateManager.addUpdateConsent()` and `forceUpdate()` take the update as an object instead of three positional arguments, so it can carry per-update options
    - Breaking: Ensure that changing any attribute of a client node sends a write to the peer; an attribute the peer's cluster type cannot express, including the global attributes, is declined locally with `UnsupportedWrite` or `UnsupportedAttribute`
    - Breaking: A commissionable advertisement stating vendor or product ID 0 now reports it absent (undefined)
    - Removed: `StructManager.assertDirectReadAuthorized()` and the direct-read authorization it backed, unused since the legacy cluster API was dropped
    - Deprecation: `ClientNodeInteraction.localStateFor()` is scheduled for removal in 0.19 together with the legacy controller API
    - Feature: Added `ServerNode.peers.commissioned` returning the commissioned `ClientNode`s
    - Feature: Added `ClientNode.disable()`/`enable()` to persistently disable/enable a commissioned peer
    - Feature: Added a `ClientNode` connection-state engine — `lifecycle.connectionState`/`connectionStateChanged`/`isConnected` and the `NodeConnectionState` enum
    - Feature: Added `ClientNodeLifecycle.isSeeded` and the `seeded` event, indicating a peer node's structure has been read from the device at least once
    - Feature: Added `Behaviors.forCluster(clusterId)` to resolve a cluster behavior type by numeric cluster id
    - Feature: A behavior reports an attribute it computes on read via the new protected `Behavior.markChanged()`
    - Feature: Added `openBasicCommissioningWindow`/`openEnhancedCommissioningWindow` on `CommissioningClient`/`ClientNode` to open a commissioning window on a commissioned peer
    - Feature: Added split/delegated commissioning — `CommissioningClient.CommissioningOptions.finalizeCommissioning` plus `ServerNode.peers.completeCommissioning(nodeId, discoveryData?, options?)`
    - Feature: Added `NetworkServer.autoStartCommissionedPeers` (default true) to opt out of auto-starting commissioned peers when the node goes online
    - Enhancement: Commissioning accepts `caseConnectionTimeout`, bounding how long it waits for the operational CASE connection that follows it
    - Enhancement: `SoftwareUpdateManager` caps the BDX block size for OTA transfers via `maxBdxBlockSize` and overrides their MRP retransmission margin via `bdxAdditionalMrpDelay`, either generally in its state or per update when giving consent
    - Enhancement: `network.profiles` accepts `bdxAdditionalMrpDelay`
    - Enhancement: A node's commissioning state records the `hostname` the device's SRV record names, alongside its addresses
    - Enhancement: Discovery reports at notice level, naming an installed BLE scanner it was not asked to use, and reports a discovery that asks for BLE where BLE is not enabled
    - Enhancement: Discovery warns where no scanner takes part in it at all
    - Enhancement: `Discovery.Options` accepts `discoveryCapabilities` to select the transports to discover on, so a caller no longer builds a `scannerFilter` for it
    - Adjustment: A node with commissioning disabled (e.g. a controller) now binds an ephemeral operational port instead of the standard Matter port (5540) when `NetworkServer.port` is unset; commissionable nodes still default to 5540 and an explicit port is always honored
    - Adjustment: A device commissioning passes over because its advertised vendor or product contradicts the onboarding payload is reported at notice level
    - Adjustment: A commissioned peer's fabric label is new reconciled to the controller's once after its subscription is first established on start by `ClientNode`
    - Adjustment: `NetworkServer.State.clientCacheFlushInterval` defaults to the storage driver's `writeCoalescingInterval` instead of a fixed 20 minutes; set it to `Instant` to persist every change immediately
    - Adjustment: A `SoftwareUpdateManager.State.announcementInterval` of `Instant` disables OTA provider announcements
    - Fix: A constraint whose bound carries a unit, such as the `0.01% to 100.00%` of a `percent100ths` value, is enforced in the units the value is encoded in
    - Fix: A window covering with no Lift feature no longer states a lift movement direction in `ConfigStatus`
    - Fix: Struct validation resolves a member stored under its TLV tag number, so a constraint violation there is caught and a mandatory member present only at its id no longer raises a conformance error
    - Fix: `Thermostat.Presets` reports to subscribers and advances the cluster's data version when the presets change
    - Fix: A local write of `Thermostat.Presets` is stored instead of silently discarded, and an invalid one rejects the caller's write
    - Fix: `Thermostat.Presets` is validated and staged for an atomic write on every endpoint that selects the Presets feature, not only where the application passed a `presets` value; presets such an endpoint stored before are ignored
    - Fix: A preset write is refused for referencing the active preset only when it removes that preset; a thermostat starting with an `ActivePresetHandle` that names no preset stores null instead of refusing to start
    - Fix: A preset write that would store a preset without a handle is refused, including where an application observer removed the handle the thermostat issued
    - Fix: A preset handle the thermostat generates is persisted, so it still addresses the preset after a restart
    - Fix: Two presets sharing a scenario and carrying no name are refused on an atomic write, as they already were on a local one
    - Fix: A state class serving an attribute from an accessor sees the values of the writing transaction
    - Fix: A write refused by pre-commit validation is announced again when the same value is written a second time on one transaction
    - Fix: A report for a quieter attribute a behavior computes on read carries an advanced cluster data version, so a subscription no longer discards it as one it already has
    - Fix: `LevelControl.RemainingTime` and `ColorControl.RemainingTime` report the time left in a transition; the attribute read 0 on any endpoint whose application did not itself pass a `remainingTime` value
    - Fix: `endpoints.size` no longer double-counts the root endpoint
    - Fix: The log line for an opened commissioning window states the timeout as a duration, not as a millisecond count labelled seconds
    - Fix: A commissioned peer's connection state leaves `Connected` as soon as its last operational session is lost
    - Fix: `ChangeNotificationService` event occurrences carry a `timestampKind` naming which of the four wire variants the timestamp is (`epoch`, `system`, `epoch-delta`, `system-delta`), so a consumer forwarding an event no longer has to guess its clock or whether it is absolute or a delta from the previous event
    - Fix: `IdentifyServer` no longer offers the optional `TriggerEffect` command unless the device type requires it, an own command implementation has been added via an override or suppression is disabled; `IdentifyServer.enable({ commands: { triggerEffect: true } })`, `IdentifyServer.alter({ commands: { triggerEffect: { optional: false } } })` and an override of `suppressTriggerEffect()` also offer it
    - Fix: `ClusterBehavior.with()` rejects a feature the cluster does not define
    - Fix: Client node values persisted under property names by earlier versions are migrated to their attribute id on load, so they stay readable
    - Fix: Writing a fabric-scoped list entry that stems from a cluster whose schema could not be resolved no longer produces two conflicting fabricIndex fields
    - Fix: A rejected write to an attribute served by dynamic properties restores the previous value instead of deleting the property, and a rejected write to a previously absent attribute leaves no slot behind instead of one holding `undefined`
    - Fix: Factory reset removes commissioned peers and the certificate authority's key material; a peer that cannot be torn down no longer blocks the reset
    - Fix: A client node's storage metadata no longer surfaces as state: a peer report that only bumps the data version emits no change notification, and `__version__` no longer appears among the changed properties or in cluster state
    - Fix: A peer that cannot be loaded, such as one whose fabric is missing locally, is reported with its actual cause instead of escaping as an unhandled rejection
    - Fix: Commissioning passes over a discovered device whose advertised vendor or product ID disagrees with the onboarding payload's
    - Fix: A level change that couples to On/Off no longer leaves the coupling blocked when its transaction rolls back
    - Fix: A cluster's feature selection is recorded as persisted only once the store accepted the values it travels with, so a failed write no longer leaves a later feature change undetected
    - Fix: Validating a state class that serves properties dynamically passes it the endpoint, as every other caller does
    - Fix: A peer that reports a cluster ID outside the ranges the specification allows no longer fails node initialization
    - Adjustment: A cluster ID is validated when a server behavior is created rather than when a cluster namespace is built, so a peer's ID stays as reported
    - Fix: Two peer clusters whose attribute or command IDs differ by 32 no longer share one generated behavior

- @matter/matter.js
    - Adjustment: The duplicate "BLE is not enabled" log lines are gone; a node reports missing BLE support once, where it decides on it

- @matter/nodejs
    - Breaking: `FileStorageDriver`'s constructor no longer accepts a `clear` argument; clearing is handled by `StorageService`
    - Adjustment: `SqliteStorageDriver` and `JsonFileStorageDriver` report a `writeCoalescingInterval` of `Instant`, so client cache data is no longer held back for 20 minutes on these drivers
    - Fix: Ensure that `--storage-clear`/`MATTER_STORAGE_CLEAR` is honored again and clears the storage on start

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Enhancement: Waiting for the Bluetooth adapter to power on before scanning or advertising is reported at notice level, naming what to check, and its start is reported once the adapter is up
    - Fix: A connection attempt that BLE reports as failed is retried instead of failing commissioning on the first try
    - Fix: A peripheral whose connection attempt failed is no longer rejected as unusable for the lifetime of the process
    - Fix: Giving up on a peripheral reports the last connection failure as cause
    - Fix: A disconnect that never completes no longer leaves the channel request pending forever
    - Fix: Aborting a BLE connection attempt now stops its retries and releases a link the attempt already established
    - Fix: Stopping an advertisement that was still waiting for the Bluetooth adapter retracts it, so the adapter powering on no longer starts an advertisement that was already given up on

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Fix: A cluster whose ID lies outside the ranges the specification allows is addressable instead of raising an error
    - Feature: Added `--cleanup-legacy-storage` to irreversibly remove the leftover pre-0.16 storage artifacts once they have been migrated to the current format
    - Fix: Attribute changes log one line per attribute, naming the attribute, instead of one line per cluster report carrying every changed attribute of that report
    - Fix: Attribute, event and connection-state log lines are recognized by the web UI again, so node tiles and device values update; event lines name the peer and render their timestamp according to the wire variant the device sent

- @matter/protocol
    - Deprecation: The legacy `DecodedDataReport` / `Decoded{Attribute,Event}Report*` types and the `normalize*` / `normalizeAndDecode*` helpers now announce removal in 0.19 instead of 0.18
    - Deprecation: The legacy `ClusterType` command request surface (`Invoke.LegacyCommandRequest`, `Specifier.ClusterTypeCommand`) and `SessionManager.owner` are scheduled for removal in 0.19
    - Enhancement: Network profiles accept a separate `bdxAdditionalMrpDelay` for bulk transfer, defaulting to the profile's messaging margin
    - Enhancement: New `CertificateAuthority.erase()` discards the authority's key material, persisted and in memory
    - Enhancement: A discovered commissionable device reports the `hostname` its SRV record names
    - Enhancement: Commissioning accepts `caseConnectionTimeout`, bounding how long it waits for the operational CASE connection that follows it; defaults to the previous fixed 4m15s
    - Fix: Cancelling BLE commissioning aborts the in-flight channel open
    - Fix: A concrete subscription path is reported only when that attribute changed; it was previously reported whenever any other attribute of the same cluster changed
    - Fix: A subscription's `maxIntervalCeiling` is transmitted exactly as requested; jitter now applies only when we derive the ceiling ourselves
    - Fix: mDNS advertisements set the cache-flush bit on the SRV, TXT and address records unique to the node
    - Fix: mDNS known-answer suppression compares what identifies a record
    - Fix: mDNS known-answer suppression only applies while more than half the known answer's lifetime remains
    - Fix: an mDNS response drops the cache-flush bit where it no longer carries the whole record set
    - Fix: a unicast mDNS response does not carry the cache-flush bit

- @matter/react-native
    - Fix: The `storage.clear` variable now clears the storage on start as it does on Node.js

- @matter/types
    - Adjustment: `ClusterType()` no longer validates the cluster ID of the model it is given
    - Breaking: `ModelBounds.createNumberBounds()` states a bound as a `bigint` where it lies beyond the safe integers, and states both `min` and `max` where it previously omitted an absent bound; `createLengthBounds()` still states a number, as a length counts what a message can carry
    - Breaking: `TlvNumericSchema.bound()` states the base type of the schema it bounds in `baseTypeMin` and `baseTypeMax`, where it previously stated the bound; the bound is stated by `min` and `max`. The class gains a protected `constrain()`
    - Breaking: A bounded 64 bit schema states its datatype again, so a legacy `ClusterType()` cluster derives the type and constraint of such an attribute instead of neither, and enforces a range it previously left open
    - Fix: A nullable 64 bit integer reserves the value that encodes null from its type rather than from its constraint, so it neither refuses the extreme its constraint states nor admits the sentinel. `ElectricalPowerMeasurement`'s `Frequency` and `PowerFactor` refused their own maximum and minimum
    - Breaking: `TlvNumericSchema.bound()` refuses a bound stated as a number that the number holds only approximately, such as `9223372036854775807` on a `uint64`, which rounded to 2^63 and admitted a value above the stated maximum. State such a bound as a `bigint`
    - Breaking: Provisional cluster elements are now typed as optional rather than always present
    - Breaking: An onboarding payload's vendor and product ID are reported absent (undefined) where it states none instead of 0
    - Feature: Added the `ClusterLookup` namespace for cluster/attribute/command/event name↔id resolution (optional `MatterModel` for custom clusters)
    - Deprecation: The `ClusterType()` factory compat layer (`RetiredClusterType`, `RetiredElements`, the TLV `element` reverse mapping) is scheduled for removal in 0.19
    - Deprecation: The generated `Cluster`, `Complete` and `<Name>Cluster` aliases and the `ClusterType.WithCompat` `with()` shim are scheduled for removal in 0.19
    - Fix: `Cluster.with()` rejects a feature the cluster does not define and returns one frozen namespace per selection
    - Fix: An onboarding payload carrying a vendor ID past the last test vendor, or a product ID of 0 beside a real vendor ID, is now rejected
    - Fix: Fixes Base38 decoding which rejected payloads whose length was a multiple of three bytes
    - Fix: A manual pairing code whose `VID_PID_PRESENT` bit disagrees with its length is now rejected

- @matter/testing
    - Enhancement: `certTest()` defines controller-side certification tests with per-step PICS gating, device-log expectations, and evidence recording; devices run as chip apps (docker or local binary) or matter.js test apps, selected via `MATTER_CERT_DEVICE`
    - Enhancement: A cert test step can declare itself `notApplicable`, recording it as skipped with a reason instead of running it
    - Enhancement: `PromptDrivenPythonTest` drives chip python test scripts that prompt for manual commissioning steps
    - Enhancement: `matter-test`'s post-test clean-exit grace period is overridable via `MATTER_TEST_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS`
    - Enhancement: `MATTER_CHIP_BINS_SOURCE=cert-bins` selects project-chip's official `connectedhomeip/chip-cert-bins` binaries for the classic yaml/python tests and `chip-local` cert-test subjects
    - Enhancement: A cert test's attached device/controller logs now carry a banner marking each step's start and end, alongside its verdict
    - Enhancement: Certification controller tests run against a controller × device matrix, adding chip-tool as a second controller alongside matter.js's own
    - Breaking: Removed the unused `PicsFile.Values` type; use `PicsValues`
    - Enhancement: New `PicsFile.with()` returns a copy of a PICS file with values overridden
    - Fix: `PromptDrivenPythonTest` now fails a run in which none of its prompt handlers fired, instead of trusting the script's own verdict
    - Enhancement: A python-wrapped cert test's evidence attaches the script's own output alongside the controller log
    - Fix: A composite `PicsSource` no longer patches the PICS file cached for its first source
    - Fix: TC-SC-3.5 turns off `PICS_SDK_CI_ONLY` so the script prompts for commissioning instead of acting as its own commissioner, and drives whichever controller `MATTER_CERT_CONTROLLER` selects
    - Enhancement: A cert test's controller reads and subscribes to events via `CertNodeApi.readEvents()`/`subscribeEvents()`, on both the matter.js and the chip-tool controller
    - Enhancement: A cert test's controller sends an invoke or attribute write as a timed interaction via `CertNodeApi`'s `timedInteractionTimeoutMs`, on both the matter.js and the chip-tool controller
    - Enhancement: A cert test's controller invokes several commands in one request via `CertNodeApi.invokeBatch()`, which reports each answer in arrival order
    - Enhancement: `certTest()` accepts `appVariant` to run a variant of the device app CHIP builds as its own binary, such as `nlfaultinject`
    - Enhancement: A cert test declares a cluster outside the Matter specification with the model annotations and `registerCertCustomCluster()`, and both controllers then address it
    - Fix: A cert test's own PICS expression now gates the test, which previously only tinted its label in the report; a controller declares the client capabilities the device's PICS file cannot, and those overlay it
    - Enhancement: `certTest()` accepts test-level `flavors`, skipping a test whose device cannot exist on the run's flavor before the device starts
    - Enhancement: A cert test's controller commissions from a QR onboarding payload via `CommissioningTarget.qrPairingCode`, on both the matter.js and the chip-tool controller

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Deprecation: Every class, type, and function of the legacy controller API is now marked deprecated and scheduled for removal in 0.19; use the `ServerNode.peers` / `ClientNode` API of `@matter/node` instead
    - Feature: `CommissioningController` accepts `clientCacheFlushInterval` to override how long node state is buffered before it is written to storage

## 0.17.9 (2026-08-06)

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: A BDX exchange retransmits its pending message early when a duplicate proves the peer is awake and still waiting for it
    - Fix: The peer's medium-specific MRP retransmission margin now applies to peer-initiated exchanges (e.g. subscription data reports) and to exchanges created without peer context
    - Fix: BDX retransmission intervals are capped so the whole MRP schedule fits inside the peer's BDX response budget, which acknowledgements do not extend; the peer's idle cadence does not raise the cap, since a peer holding an open exchange is in active mode
    - Fix: A retransmission timer is no longer armed for a message that was acknowledged while an earlier transmission of it was still in flight, which left the timer running unreferenced
    - Fix: Grouped `PeerTimingParameters` (`kickRestartCooldown`, `addressChangeProbeCooldown`) merge field-wise, so overriding one member keeps its siblings
    - Fix: Ensure that an unsecured session created for an inbound message is discarded when no protocol handler adopts it
    - Fix: Ensure that closed exchanges are removed from their session for all session types
    - Fix: Ensure that a session releases its message channel when the transport owns the underlying channel, so the channel address observer of PASE, CASE and discarded inbound sessions is removed
    - Fix: Ensure that the end of a session is logged also when its channel was detached before; channel detach is now logged as debug

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: `network.timing` accepts the kick and address-change parameters
    - Enhancement: Managed state derives a member's container key through one shared implementation (no functional change)
    - Fix: Client node state reads and writes struct- and list-valued fields nested inside an attribute value
    - Fix: Client node state reads struct- and list-valued attributes of a cluster implementation that supplies properties dynamically

## 0.17.8 (2026-08-02)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `isIPv4` no longer misclassifies a link-local IPv6 address as IPv4 when its zone index contains a dot, e.g. a Linux VLAN interface name like `eth0.100`

- @matter/node
    - Fix: Closing a session from the stack of an in-flight subscription report no longer deadlocks the session in its closing state
    - Fix: A subscription report that goes unanswered abandons the subscription instead of declaring the controller lost and closing every session with it
    - Fix: Subscriptions now give up after repeated send failures; the check never matched the error MRP exhaustion raises
    - Fix: Re-establishing former subscriptions stops for a peer that is unreachable instead of spending a full retransmission window on each of its subscriptions
    - Fix: The exchange opened to re-establish a former subscription is now closed

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Enhancement: BLE disconnect logs now include the noble disconnect reason with its HCI status text

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: `SoftwareUpdateManager.queuedUpdates` reports transferred bytes and transfer size of a running BDX transfer
    - Fix: OTA updates are no longer reset as stalled while their BDX transfer is still moving data
    - Fix: The in-progress entry of an OTA download is no longer dropped while its BDX transfer is still running
    - Fix: A BDX session opened for a retry within the same query cycle is tracked like the first one

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: `BdxSession` exposes `transferredBytes` and `dataLength`

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Fix: `nodes ota check|download|apply` and `ota download` now default to a `--mode auto` that follows the `config ota-test-images` setting instead of always querying the production DCL only
    - Fix: `config ota-test-images set` applies immediately instead of requiring a shell restart
    - Fix: `ota add` accepts `http(s)` URLs instead of rejecting them before its download path was reached

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: `Subscription.isCanceledByPeer` is now `isTerminated`, covering both a peer cancellation and our own giving up
    - Enhancement: `MessageExchange.Options.suppressPeerLoss` waives peer-loss inference for every operation on an exchange
    - Fix: Peer loss reported for a commissioned peer now conveys the exchange that failed
    - Fix: A session nearing message counter rollover now winds down as its own task instead of on the stack of the send that consumed the counter
    - Fix: A peer that keeps establishing sessions no longer accumulates them without bound; the least recently used beyond five are closed

## 0.17.7 (2026-07-27)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `Heap` now stores each item at most once and maintains its position index eagerly, so deleting an item added after an earlier deletion works reliably

- @matter/model
    - Enhancement: `MatterModel.withClusters()` returns a copy of a model with clusters added or replaced by ID

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: Controllers accept a custom Matter model via the `matter` option so a commissioned peer's custom or extended cluster elements resolve to real names instead of synthetic `attr$…`/`command$…` identifiers
    - Enhancement: `SoftwareUpdateManager.checkForUpdates()` forces an immediate OTA update check and cleanup of obsolete stored updates
    - Enhancement: Custom server session intervals (idle/active interval, active threshold) are now configurable via `sessions.intervals`
    - Fix: Optimize Cluster data updates when structures change for ClientNodes
    - Fix: Prevent subscriptions from being activated on a closing session
    - Fix: Thermostat adjusts the coupled setpoint limit to preserve the AutoMode deadband instead of rejecting the write
    - Fix: Choice conformance no longer requires a member gated by an inapplicable condition (e.g. `[ICTL].b+` when the feature is unsupported)
    - Fix: Support the `!=` (not-equal) operator in value conformance expressions
    - Fix: Ensure `FabricAuthority` is fully constructed before it is used in the WebRTC Transport Requestor, OTA Software Update Provider, and Software Update clusters
    - Fix: Consider existing node IDs when determining the next node ID to commission
    - Fix: Determine the network medium of nodes without a Network Commissioning cluster from the WiFi or Thread Network Diagnostics cluster on their root endpoint

- @matter/nodejs
    - Fix: Ensure the namespace directory exists before the `sqlite` storage driver opens the database

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: Connect to a newly discovered address as soon as it supersedes the previously cached address instead of waiting out the connection retry delay
    - Fix: Ensure the commissioning failsafe timer stays within the device's maximum cumulative failsafe
    - Fix: Parallel PASE commissioning now uses the won session immediately instead of blocking on losing attempts' cleanup, which could let the won session expire at the device failsafe before use
    - Fix: A device dropped during parallel PASE for invalid credentials no longer accepts a slower successful attempt on another of its addresses
    - Fix: Extend the handling of non-compliant devices that drop the commissioning connection when network details are added (`AddOrUpdateWiFi`/`AddOrUpdateThread`), not only on `ConnectNetwork`, treating them as non-concurrent and proceeding directly to operational discovery
    - Fix: Clear group message reception (replay) state when a group key set is removed or rewritten, so valid messages are not rejected as replays after a key set is re-provisioned with a reused epoch key
    - Fix: A subscription reaching its timeout at the current instant now expires instead of rescheduling a zero-length timeout repeatedly

- @matter/testing
    - Fix: Mock timers implement the `Timer.interval` accessor, so assignments take effect on the next start, reads no longer return `undefined` and out-of-range intervals are rejected as in production
    - Fix: Mock timers report `isPeriodic` correctly and restart instead of double-arming when started while running
    - Fix: `MockTime.advance()` fails with a diagnostic instead of spinning when a timer rearms without letting mock time advance

## 0.17.6 (2026-07-16)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `Observable.detachObservers()` now disarms the source observable (including active async iteration) and `attachObservers()` preserves once-semantics of the transferred observers
    - Fix: Async iteration over an `Observable` now delivers emitted values (previously it ended immediately) and terminates cleanly on dispose instead of spinning

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: After an approved OTA update, the controller re-subscribes to a rebooted device that does not persist subscriptions within ~30s instead of waiting out the previous subscription's timeout
    - Fix: Attributes added when a peer cluster gains features at runtime are now readable
    - Fix: Event listeners now survive a behavior drop/re-inject cycle (observer transplant was silently dropping them) and the rebuilt events surface is correctly wired for event reporting

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Fix: Update noble dependency to fix some DBUS related issues

- @matter/protocol
    - Fix: Peer session selection now prefers the session the peer was last heard from and skips peer-lost sessions, so a dead session still retransmitting no longer outranks a freshly established one
    - Fix: `BleScanner.close()` no longer orphans a timeout-less continuous discovery, which previously blocked shutdown when a BLE commission was in flight
    - Fix: Do not drop reordered unsecured/PASE messages with a counter just below the first one seen as duplicates

- @matter/thread-br-client
    - Fix: Use the correct MeshCoP commissioner keep-alive URI (`c/ca`) and resign the session with a rejecting keep-alive instead of a nonexistent `c/cr` release URI that Border Routers answered with 4.04

- @matter/types
    - Fix: `ObjectSchema.injectField`/`removeField` no longer crash on fabric-scoped commands that omit an optional nested struct field

## 0.17.5 (2026-07-13)

- @matter/\*:
    - Upgraded to Matter specification version 1.6.0. Newly-mandatory attributes are seeded with conservative defaults, and new/provisional clusters stay behind feature guards, so existing code should remain backward compatible

- @matter/general
    - Enhancement: `deepCopy` now clones `Set` and `Map` values instead of turning them into empty objects
    - Enhancement: Added `Timestamp.toMicroseconds` and clarified `Time.nowUs` as a high-resolution millisecond timestamp (now sub-millisecond precise), not a microsecond value

- @matter/model
    - Enhancement: Added cluster-variance rules for the Matter 1.6 conformance idioms
    - Fix: Initialize class metadata via `Object.defineProperty` so importing matter.js no longer throws when `Function.prototype[Symbol.metadata]` is non-writable (TC39 decorator-metadata / core-js polyfill, reported by Sylvan86)

- @matter/node
    - Feature: Server-side Intermittently Connected Device (ICD) support via the IcdManagement cluster: client registration/unregistration, StayActiveRequest, SIT/LIT operating modes with DSLS, and Check-In delivery to registered clients
    - Feature: Controller-side ICD support: automatic client registration with multi-admin protection, Check-In handling, and peer wakefulness/availability tracking for sleepy LIT devices
    - Feature: Implemented the newly-mandatory Matter 1.6 diagnostics attributes
    - Feature: Enabled the BooleanState `StateChange` event by default via the new feature
    - Feature: Emit the OccupancySensing `OccupancyChanged` event automatically when the `OccupancyEvent` feature is enabled
    - Feature: Advertise the BasicInformation CapabilityMinima defaults and enforce the read/subscribe path-count ceiling
    - Feature: Added a ConfigurationVersion increment convenience API and reject ConfigurationVersion bumps on bridged devices that do not enable the attribute
    - Feature: Added a `configurationVersionChanged` endpoint/node lifecycle event that fires when a client peer's ConfigurationVersion changes (BasicInformation on the node, BridgedDeviceBasicInformation on bridged endpoints)
    - Feature: Preparations for Groupcast support (still provisional in Matter 1.6.0)
    - Feature: Adds a default WebRtcTransportRequestorServer implementation with session tracking, fabric/peer identity checks on commands, transport events, and ACL auto-install for the requestor cluster
    - Fix: Prune GroupKeyMap entries when a key set is removed
    - Fix: Tag manufacturer-extension (MEI) attributes with `WildcardSkipCustomElements` so wildcard reads skip them
    - Fix: Manufacturer-specific attributes in standard clusters are now filtered by the `WildcardSkipCustomElements` flag instead of `WildcardSkipGlobalAttributes` during wildcard path expansion
    - Fix: Signal subscription "alive" when a sustained subscription (re)establishes so peer structure changes are surfaced immediately instead of at the next periodic report
    - Fix: Signal subscription "alive" on empty max-interval keepalive reports, so a quiet peer keeps refreshing its liveness signal
    - Fix: Bound node shutdown so an interaction parked awaiting an MRP ack from an unresponsive peer (e.g. a restarted ICD) can no longer hang close
    - Fix: Also respect local (imported/stored) OTA images when checking for available updates, not only the DCL
    - Fix: Harden endpoint structure processing against non-compliant peers that omit mandatory Descriptor list attributes, treating an absent list as empty instead of crashing

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Feature: Added `icd` shell commands to register/unregister/stay-active ICD clients and inspect/watch node wakefulness and availability
    - Fix: Close a path-containment gap in the optional web server that let requests reach sibling directories sharing the web-root name prefix, and resolve symlinks before serving (reported by tonghuaroot)
    - Fix: Bind the WebSocket/web server to loopback (127.0.0.1) by default instead of all interfaces; added a `--webAddress` option to choose the listen address

- @matter/protocol
    - Feature: ICD Check-In protocol: CheckInMessage codec with counter-validation and replay protection, Check-In sender, and controller-side peer wakefulness scheduling
    - Enhancement: Worst-case MRP response-time now accounts for the sender's fixed-backoff/additional-delay pad
    - Enhancement: WiFi peers now use a dedicated network profile with a 1s additive MRP retransmission margin, selected by operational medium for dual-stack nodes
    - Feature: Preparations for Groupcast support (provisional in Matter 1.6.0)
    - Feature: Source the client read path-count hint from the peer's advertised CapabilityMinima floors
    - Feature: Added a Thread operational dataset codec (`OperationalDataset`, `SecurityPolicy`, MeshCoP TLV helpers)
    - Feature: Thread commissioning derives the network name from the operational dataset when none is supplied, and declines when a supplied name contradicts the dataset
    - Enhancement: Optimized Subscription minIntervalFloor: now defaults to 0s; only Thread devices older than Matter 1.3.0 keep a 1s floor, and any node with a Generic Switch endpoint opts back into 0s for faster switch events
    - Fix: Single-command invokes no longer sending a commandRef on the wire nor require one echoed in the response
    - Fix: Single commands skip auto-batching when the peer accepts only one path per invoke or the response is suppressed
    - Fix: Closing a client interaction aborts an in-flight command batch instead of awaiting its response
    - Fix: Ensures group messaging works correctly when multiple key sets share a group session id
    - Fix: Cap a peer-negotiated BDX block size to the transport payload size, so OTA blocks no longer exceed the UDP message limit
    - Fix: Report a sustained subscription's fallback `maxInterval` in seconds instead of a millisecond value while no subscription is established

- @matter/thread-br-client
    - Feature: Added as new package to support communication with Thread Border Routers through CoAP and with OpenThread Border Routers via REST (if exposed)

- @matter/types
    - Enhancement: Added the NFC Transport Layer (NTL, bit 4) capability to the onboarding payload Discovery Capabilities bitmap

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Fix: Harden endpoint structure processing against non-compliant peers that omit mandatory Descriptor list attributes; treat an absent list as empty and warn-and-ignore missing device types instead of crashing

## 0.17.4 (2026-07-01)

- @matter/general
    - Enhancement: Inbound mDNS packets are dropped before a full decode when none of the names any subscriber registered appear in them, reducing CPU usage on busy networks

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: Optimizes incoming DataReport processing
    - Enhancement: Frees a behavior's persisted seed values from memory once the datasource has loaded them
    - Adjustment: Rejects an invalid Basic Information VendorID (0 or above 0xFFF4) or ProductID (0) as a device identity
    - Adjustment: A client write interaction to a peer no longer rejects conformance violations locally; the value is forwarded so the device decides, while value-range and datatype errors still fail fast
    - Fix: A peer's mDNS advertisement at the 1-hour SII/SAI cap no longer lowers a higher CASE-negotiated idle/active interval already on record
    - Fix: Ensures that a peer's FeatureMap change rebuilds the affected client cluster behavior
    - Fix: A peer reporting an empty AttributeList no longer breaks client cluster schema generation; the discovered schema falls back to the attributes actually received
    - Fix: A client cluster the peer still serves data for but omits from its descriptor server list is no longer dropped when subsequent endpoint data is processed
    - Fix: Ensures that fabric-scoped attribute data (e.g. stale AccessControl ACL entries) is always sanitized at node startup
    - Fix: A misconfigured environment/configuration value for a behavior (unknown property or unconvertible value) is now logged and skipped instead of crashing endpoint initialization
    - Fix: An invoke with SuppressResponse still returns the Invoke Response when a command produces response data, instead of suppressing it unconditionally
    - Fix: Aligned Thermostat atomic-write handling with the Matter specification
    - Fix: Ensures that client clusters are never exposed to incoming interactions
    - Fix: The generated manual pairing code now reflects the configured commissioning flow, including Vendor ID and Product ID for non-Standard flows
    - Fix: Ensures that a rejected SetRegulatoryConfig leaves BasicInformation.location unchanged, instead of writing the country code before validating the regulatory config
    - Fix: Diagnostics now log endpoint number 0 instead of "(unassigned)"

- @matter/nodejs
    - Fix: On `process.exit`, verifies all storages were properly closed and removes orphaned lock files otherwise, so a forgotten close no longer blocks the next startup

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: Caches attribute/event schema resolution while decoding incoming data reports to reduce decode time
    - Enhancement: Incoming read/subscription data reports now tolerate signed/unsigned integer encoding mismatches within defined bounds. Such cases are still non-compliant and are logged
    - Enhancement: Unified peer device-probing across the mDNS address-change and subscription-liveness cases so they no longer probe independently
    - Adjustment: A GitHub rate-limit response while downloading certificates now skips the remaining GitHub fetches for that run, and is logged at debug instead of info when matching test certificates are already cached
    - Fix: CASE/PASE session parameters with idle/active intervals above one hour are now accepted instead of declining the session; the one-hour cap is applied only when advertising over DNS-SD like in CHIP SDK
    - Fix: A local Session Active Threshold above its 65535ms (uint16) maximum is now rejected up front with a clear error instead of failing later during message encoding
    - Fix: The operational (fallback) address now updates when the session channel follows a peer's new source address, instead of going stale
    - Fix: Certificate SubjectKeyIdentifier and AuthorityKeyIdentifier are derived as 160-bit SHA-1
    - Fix: Certificates are rejected on decode when exceeding the size limits (400 bytes TLV for the NOC chain and VVSC, 600 bytes DER for the NOC and DAC chains)
    - Fix: OTA image digest type identifiers follow the IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry (RFC 6920), and the digest algorithm is validated when reading an image
    - Fix: Fabric-sensitive events are now always filtered to the accessing fabric on read and subscribe
    - Fix: A stray StatusReport arriving as an exchange's initial message (e.g. a retransmitted CASE/PASE completion) is now ignored instead of logging an "Unhandled error"
    - Fix: An invoke client now reports `NoCommandResponse` for sent commands that receive no response, and discards unexpected/unmatched response entries instead of throwing
    - Fix: The BLE Extended-Announcement flag is only set during the extended-announcement period, no longer when private details are omitted outside that window
    - Fix: Fixes encoding and decoding of a message payload header carrying a vendor Protocol ID
    - Fix: Does not send error status messages when the message before was never delivered for PASE/CASE
    - Fix: Clamps the outer interaction-model status to SUCCESS/FAILURE when a cluster-specific status is present
    - Fix: Rejects a DataVersion on a group or wildcard write path
    - Fix: Ensures that DataReports always contain data or a status for attributes and never the IsUrgent flag in event data 

- @matter/types
    - Fix: TLV character strings are truncated at the first Information Separator 1 (0x1F) on decode, and a character string containing IS1 is rejected on validation
    - Fix: Onboarding-payload version is validated on decode — a reserved QR version (≠ 0) or manual pairing code first digit (≥ 8) is rejected instead of being mis-parsed
    - Fix: The manual pairing code codec now requires Vendor ID and Product ID for non-Standard commissioning flows
    - Fix: The onboarding-payload TLV codec rejects reserved tags (0x05–0x7F; manufacturer-specific tags must use 0x80–0xFF) and requires the PBKDF iteration count and salt to be both present or both absent

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Fix: `PairedNode.connect()` now applies the subscription interval options passed to it, instead of ignoring them

## 0.17.3 (2026-06-17)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `log.level` (e.g. `MATTER_LOG_LEVEL`) now accepts string level names like `info` again, not just numeric values
    - Fix: A failed UDP multicast send now evicts and rebuilds the broadcast channel instead of caching a dead socket
    - Fix: SPAKE2+ now samples the ephemeral scalar bounded by the group order `n` instead of the field prime `p`

- @matter/model
    - Fix: Changed interaction model revision back to 12 because revision 13 only includes a provisional feature
    - Fix: The conformance parser now rejects invalid choice and optionality constructs instead of mis-parsing them

- @matter/node
    - Fix: Reading `CommissioningServer` pairing codes before commissioning is initialized now throws a clear error instead of emitting a placeholder code
    - Fix: Ensures that the negotiated subscription MaxInterval stays at or above the requested MinIntervalFloor when the floor exceeds the 60-minute publisher limit
    - Fix: Ensures that a repeated atomic-write BeginWrite from the same client on a cluster/endpoint returns INVALID_IN_STATE for any attributes

- @matter/protocol
    - Fix: Ensures that the peer-medium-specific `additionalMrpDelay` is also used for executed commands, and added an optional per-request `additionalMrpDelay` override
    - Adjustment: MRP now selects the active/idle retransmission interval by peer activity for every transmission including the first, instead of forcing the first transmission to the idle interval
    - Fix: Prevents a crash when a PASE pairing timeout fires while a previous message is still awaiting acknowledgement
    - Fix: A discovery kick no longer restarts an in-flight CASE handshake when a restart would barely shorten the next retransmission, avoiding needless teardown of a sleepy peer's exchange
    - Fix: The MRP retransmission interval is no longer capped below the peer's idle interval
    - Fix: The connection fallback address is now compared by value, so a rediscovered last-known address is no longer mistaken for an address change
    - Fix: Ensures that subscriptions established through an interaction are closed when the interaction closes (e.g. node disable/disconnect or decommission)
    - Fix: Ensures spec-compliant read/subscribe/write/invoke responses for a model-known but absent high-privilege attribute, event, or command
    - Fix: Decodes VendorID/ProductID from the "fallback method" (`Mvid:`/`Mpid:` in the commonName) of attestation certificates

- @matter/types
    - Enhancement: Added `isValidPasscode()`/`assertValidPasscode()` for onboarding passcode validation
    - Fix: Ensure that passcodes are valid when encoding or decoding pairing codes
    - Fix: Ensures that the most-significant bit of a nullable bitmap is reserved for NULL as defined in the Matter specification

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Fix: Ensure that `PairedNode.connect()` reconnects a node that was previously disconnected

## 0.17.2 (2026-06-09)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: An empty mDNS TXT record is now encoded as a single zero byte as required by RFC 6763 §6.1
    - Fix: AES-CCM encryption now honors the `byteOffset` of subarray inputs for plaintext and AAD
    - Fix: Ensure that variable name sanitization does not throw on special characters adjacent to dots (e.g. node IDs like `Dyson360VisNav™`)

- @matter/node
    - Fix: Ensure that Self-bindings also detect cluster servers added to an endpoint at runtime via `behaviors.require` and ignore client clusters on the endpoint
    - Fix: OnOff timed-off handling now honors the `0xFFFF` "hold indefinitely" value for OnTime/OffWaitTime
    - Fix: Peers commissioned with a custom id via `commission({ id })` are now restored correctly from storage on restart
    - Fix: Writing a bitmap attribute with reserved (undefined) bits set now returns ConstraintError instead of being silently accepted
    - Fix: A TCP-enabled server now reports TCP support in its session parameters (not only in mDNS), so peers learn it during PASE/CASE
    - Fix: Claim the peer node ID only once a candidate wins PASE, to avoid spurious "peer address already in use" conflicts across parallel commissioning attempts
    - Fix: Refreshing a discovered node's metadata while it is being commissioned no longer crashes the process with a synchronous transaction conflict
    - Fix: Ensure that decommissioning removes a node locally even when the device drops the RemoveFabric response after closing the session, and no longer stalls shutdown
    - Fix: Ensure that probing a node during teardown reports it unreachable instead of throwing

- @matter/protocol
    - Enhancement: Implemented Matter message privacy (header obfuscation) for group messages; receiving is always supported, sending is opt-in per session and off by default. Unicast messages carrying the privacy flag are dropped like in CHIP SDK
    - Enhancement: SII/SAI/SAT keys are now omitted from advertised DNS-SD TXT records when at their default values, matching CHIP SDK behavior
    - Enhancement: MRP retransmission additive delay is now a tunable per-`NetworkProfile.additionalMrpDelay` instead of a fixed constant
    - Enhancement: Subscription maxIntervalCeiling now lengthens by up to +max(10%, 10s) one-sided jitter for all device types (previously only Thread-active devices)
    - Enhancement: Prefer TCP for operational connections when the peer advertises TCP-server support via its session parameters or mDNS; a negotiated TCP session is declined only on an explicit no-TCP report
    - Enhancement: Lengthened the BTP handshake-response timeout (5s → 15s) and central idle timeout (30s → 60s) to match CHIP
    - Enhancement: Added `PeerMessageMissingError` (subtype of `PeerUnresponsiveError`) thrown when an expected message does not arrive on an active exchange, distinguishing it from a request that was never acknowledged
    - Fix: Ignore announced TCP support for peers reporting Matter spec version < 1.5.0
    - Fix: Corrected the Session Active Threshold limit to 65535 milliseconds (was wrongly checked against 65535 seconds)
    - Fix: Invalid or out-of-range SII/SAI/SAT values in discovered DNS-SD TXT records are now ignored so MRP defaults apply, as required by the Matter spec
    - Fix: Added size checks for Message Extensions and Secured Extensions length fields on message decode
    - Fix: MRP retransmissions now use the idle interval when the peer left its active window mid-exchange, matching CHIP SDK behavior
    - Fix: A failed operational reconnect caused by a network-layer send error (e.g. ENETUNREACH on a stale persisted address) now triggers mDNS rediscovery instead of retrying the unreachable address indefinitely
    - Fix: TcpChannel now closes the connection on a zero-length stream frame instead of silently skipping it, preventing a peer from holding a connection slot open indefinitely
    - Fix: A forward message-counter jump of exactly the window size no longer retains stale replay-bitmap bits, which could wrongly reject a later legitimate message as duplicate
    - Fix: When the per-session concurrent-exchange limit is exceeded, the least-recently-active exchange is now closed instead of the oldest-created one
    - Fix: A Sigma1 carrying only one of `resumptionId`/`initiatorResumeMic` is now rejected with INVALID_PARAMETER instead of being treated as a fresh handshake
    - Fix: Group-send epoch-key selection no longer fails when a future-dated epoch key is installed during key rotation
    - Fix: Group data message counters are now a single node-global counter (per Matter spec) instead of per operational key; former per-key counters are properly migrated to prevent nonce reuse
    - Fix: Ensure that the default `regulatoryCountryCode` ("XX") is applied when commissioning a Wi-Fi/Thread device without an explicit value
    - Fix: BTP central now advertises the negotiated ATT_MTU minus the 3-byte GATT header as its segment size, so a peer no longer selects fragments that overflow the link
    - Fix: BTP window accounting now counts outstanding packets by modular distance, fixing a miscount across the sequence-number wrap
    - Fix: BTP now reserves the remote receive window's last slot for an acknowledgement and sends a stand-alone ack proactively once its own receive window runs low
    - Fix: BTP now resumes a stalled send queue when an incoming acknowledgement reopens the window
    - Fix: BTP now closes the session if reassembly exceeds the declared message length
    - Fix: BTP commits the acknowledged sequence number before awaiting the write so a stand-alone ack and a concurrent data send no longer acknowledge the same sequence twice (a duplicate ack is rejected by spec-compliant peers)
    - Fix: BTP no longer issues a stand-alone ack into a full remote receive window or concurrently with an in-flight fragment write
    - Fix: A corrupted PAA in the local DCL certificate cache is now re-fetched from DCL once before failing, recovering from broken storage
    - Fix: Unexpected errors during device attestation validation (e.g. an unrecoverably corrupt trust-store certificate) are now surfaced as an attestation finding for the `onAttestationFailure` policy to judge, instead of aborting commissioning outside the findings mechanism

- @matter/node
    - Enhancement: Added `network.ownNetworkProfileId` to set the local network's MRP additive margin, and exposed `additionalMrpDelay` and `probeAddress` in network profile config

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Fix: Stored Wi-Fi/Thread credentials are only applied during commissioning when their values are non-empty, so an empty operational dataset no longer fails commissioning of IP-only devices
    - Fix: `config wifi/thread set` now rejects empty credential values

## 0.17.1 (2026-06-03)

- @matter/\*
    - Enhancement: Standardized log levels across all packages against a new logging guideline (see `docs/LOGGING.md`)

- @matter/general
    - Fix: `causedBy`/`asError`/`errorOf`/`repackErrorAs` no longer crash with "undefined is not an object" when invoked with `undefined`/`null` as error object
    - Fix: IpService now also emits changed event when the TXT reconrd changes to ensure updates of the descriptor

- @matter/model
    - Fix: Remove invalid FabricIndex field from four commands
    - Fix: Correct the Device type revision of Room Air Conditioner

- @matter/node
  - Fix: Roll back assigned Fabric from PASE session on AddNOC/UpdateNOC failure

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Feature: Added `--fabric-filtered` flag (default `true`) to the attribute read commands to control fabric filtering

- @matter/protocol
    - Feature: New `TrustedAsTestCertificate` attestation finding lets `onAttestationFailure` decide whether to accept devices whose PAA is only in the trust store as a test certificate; previously these failed with `PaaNotTrusted`. Adds per-call `considerTestCertificates` and a separate `acceptTestCertificates` trust policy on `DclCertificateService`
    - Feature: `OnAttestationFailure` callback may return a `string` (wraps the underlying error as `cause` of a new `CommissioningError`) or throw to propagate verbatim
    - Adjustment: Default-accept policies (`onAttestationFailure === true`/`undefined`) now commission test-PAA-only devices that previously failed; upgrade the policy to keep rejecting
    - Deprecation: Internally used `DecodedDataReport`, `DecodedAttributeReport{Value,Status,Entry}`, `DecodedEventReport{Value,Status,Entry}`, `DecodedEventData`, and the `normalize*` / `normalizeAndDecode*` helpers moved to `@project-chip/matter.js/cluster`. Scheduled for removal in 0.19
    - Enhancement: `ReadResult.EventValue` exposes the four wire timestamp variants (`epochTimestamp`, `systemTimestamp`, `deltaEpochTimestamp`, `deltaSystemTimestamp`) alongside the existing collapsed `timestamp: number`
    - Adjustment: `ReadResult.Chunk` may now be an async iterable (`InputChunk` is an async generator); consumers iterate chunk contents with `for await … of chunk`. Mainly internal
    - Fix: Fixes message counter rollover logic
    - Fix: Event reports are now decoded in wire (EventNumber) order
    - Fix: Allows CSRs with an empty subject as per Matter spec
    - Fix: Corrects BTP handshake decoding of version field

- @matter/types
    - Fix: Remove invalid FabricIndex field from four commands

## 0.17.0 (2026-05-20)

- Breaking: Matter 1.5/1.5.1 specification introduces some changes, as always with new Matter specification versions. You might need to adjust your code.
    - Some Namespaces were renamed and now have a "Common*" prefix
    - Several previous "Zigbee only" features, attributes, and commands were removed because they were never allowed for Matter

- @matter/\*
    - Upgraded to Matter specification version 1.5/1.5.1
    - 20%–50% RAM usage reductions and improvements

- @matter/general
    - Breaking: Blob/File-related storage methods were removed from the normal Storage implementation
    - Breaking: `DnsCodec.decodeTxtRecord`/`encodeTxtRecord` and the `TxtRecord` factory now operate on `Bytes[]` per RFC 6763 §6 so binary TXT values (e.g. Thread MeshCoP `xa`, `xp`, `at`, `pt`, `sb`, `dd`) survive encode/decode losslessly; `encodeTxtRecord` and `TxtRecord` accept `(Bytes | string)[]` so ASCII-only senders are unchanged
    - Feature: Added a new `wal`-based storage engine (not yet the default) to optimize persistence
    - Feature: `DnssdName.parameters` and `IpService.parameters` now return a `DnssdParameters` instance — a `ReadonlyMap<string, string>` plus a `.raw(key): Bytes` accessor for binary TXT consumers (e.g. Thread Border Router enrichment)
    - Enhancement: Added locking to storage implementations to prevent concurrent access issues and data corruption
    - Enhancement: Split out Blob-Storage into its own `dir`-based BlobStorage implementation
    - Enhancement: Added Storage Migration logic that can generically migrate between different storage engines
    - Enhancement: `LogFormat.format` renders any Diagnostic-loggable value to a string in the specified format (defaults to plain text)

- @matter/main
    - Feature: Added `version` string export that exposes the published matter.js version

- @matter/model
    - Breaking: Type-specific Model subfields such as "clusters" and "attributes" no longer support array-like positional access; use `Matter.clusters.at(4)` instead of `Matter.clusters[4]`
    - Breaking: Attributes declared by decorators (`@attribute(...)`) now default to read-only (`R V`); apply the `writable` decorator to attributes that must accept writes
    - Enhancement: Model preparations for Matter 1.5 and 1.5.1
    - Enhancement: The fluent API for manipulating the Matter data model is improved
    - Enhancement: Enhances decorator capabilities for attributes, clusters, and (matter and non-matter) commands

- @matter/node
    - Feature: (@adeepn) Added `DclBehavior` for centralized DCL configuration via environment variables (`MATTER_DCL_*`), config files, or programmatic setup
    - Feature: `CommissioningClient.BaseCommissioningOptions` now accepts `wifiNetwork`, `threadNetwork`, `regulatoryLocation`, and `regulatoryCountryCode` for passing network credentials and regulatory configuration during commissioning
    - Feature: `onAttestationFailure` commissioning option for controlling attestation validation policy (true/false/callback with typed findings)
    - Feature: ServerNode Network behavior options allow to set `tcp` (boolean) to enable TCP support for the server node
    - Feature: ServerNode Network behavior options allow to set `transportPreference` ("udp"/"tcp") to define the preferred connection type when peers support both. "udp" is the default and fallback
    - Feature: DoorLockServer is fully implemented except for Aliro features
    - Feature: The new Supervision() factory allows for fine-grained control of validation for state, commands, and arbitrary JS values
    - Feature: Added `Endpoint.get()` and `Endpoint.getStateOf()` — async read API with optional `fabricFilter` control; on a client endpoint issues a single batched Matter Read; on a server endpoint returns a snapshot of local state
    - Feature: Added `Endpoint.featuresOf()` / `maybeFeaturesOf()` — typed access to a cluster behavior's active feature flags
    - Feature: Added `Endpoint.globalsOf()` / `maybeGlobalsOf()` — exposes the global cluster attribute state
    - Feature: Allows ServerNode endpoints to declare client clusters via e.g. `OnOffLightDevice.with(OccupancySensingClient)`. Mandatory clients are auto-registered
    - Feature: Added support for Cluster client bindings: `BindingServer` events `established` / `removed` are emitted for defined bindings with Node references preinstalled on the materialized endpoint. See the new OccupancyBindingDevice example. To receive attribute changes from a bound peer set `resolution.node.set({ network: { defaultSubscription: Read(Read.Attribute({ ... })), autoSubscribe: true } })`
    - Enhancement: `Behavior` events `interactionEnd` and `interactionBegin` now also fire for local `act()` writes, to be in sync with wire-driven interactions
    - Enhancement: Added string-id overloads to `commandsOf()`, `eventsOf()`, `stateOf()`/`maybeStateOf()`
    - Enhancement: Re-establish subscriptions in parallel per peer on device/bridge startup
    - Enhancement: Added more warnings on invalid values for BasicInformation cluster
    - Adjustment: Because we saw devices in the wild that needed up to 2 minutes to respond to mDNS queries, we increased the discovery time for commissioning targets to 3 minutes (previously 1 minute)
    - Fix: Ensures that attribute changes which happened during an initial subscription seeding with dataVersion filtering are still reported afterwards
    - Fix: Only exports atomic-commands in Thermostat cluster server when relevant features are supported
    - Fix: Properly cancels subscriptions that were canceled by the peer but were still in resubmission state
    - Fix: Preserves clusters in the structure even if they are not specified in the serverList of the endpoint but are reported in data ("Schrödinger's cluster")
    - Fix: You can now assign bare objects composed of managed values to state properties
    - Fix: ClientNode `setStateOf` accepts `FabricIndex.OMIT_FABRIC` for fabric-scoped struct entries (Matter §7.13.6) and substitutes the peer's assigned fabric index so the local cache mirrors what the peer stores

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Fix: Fixes several crash or blocking cases around BLE and the usage in commissioning

- @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Feature: Added `cert check-revoked` command for checking certificate revocation data
    - Enhancement: Allows configuring whether test OTA images are also accepted when devices query for updates

- @matter/protocol
    - Breaking: Removed automatic retry-logic for interactions on node-reachability issues; a new session will be initialized automatically afterward
    - Breaking: Some of the lower-level APIs in @matter/protocol have changed.  This will be transparent to most users
    - Feature: We have rewritten the logic for establishing operational connections to other nodes.  The new implementation should be faster, more resilient, and offers more knobs for tuning
    - Feature: A new "network profile" feature allows you to tune parallelism and other interaction parameters based on categories including transport type and thread channel
    - Feature: matter.js now responds immediately to IP changes advertised via MDNS
    - Feature: (@adeepn) `DclConfig` is now an interface with namespace defaults instead of a singleton; `DclClient` accepts `DclConfig` for configurable endpoints
    - Feature: (@adeepn) `DclCertificateService` and `DclOtaUpdateService` accept custom DCL endpoint configuration via options
    - Feature: Device attestation validation during commissioning per Matter spec 6.2.3.1 — certificate chain verification, attestation signature/nonce, Certification Declaration validation, and certificate revocation checks via CRL
    - Feature: Attestation findings model with error/warning/info levels and configurable policy callback for custom commissioning decisions
    - Feature: CRL revocation support in `DclCertificateService` — fetches from production DCL on demand, validates the signer chain against trusted PAAs, verifies CRL signature and integrity
    - Feature: `CertificationDeclaration.parse()` for CMS/PKCS#7 signed CD extraction and signature verification
    - Feature: Enhances DclVendorInfoService and DclCertificateService with an option to seed data to support cases where no internal connection is available (@matter/dcl-data package gets published daily)
    - Enhancement: Attestation local checks (nonce, signature, VendorID, CD fields) run even without `DclCertificateService`; DCL-dependent checks (PAA trust, chain, revocation) require it
    - Enhancement: Server-side `DeviceCertification` validates DAC/PAI VendorID and ProductID against product description at startup
    - Enhancement: Enhances the strategy when multiple devices are discovered for the same commissioning target
    - Enhancement: When multiple IP addresses are available for a device during commissioning, all are tried in parallel for faster connection
    - Enhancement: An `AbortSignal` can now be passed to cancel an in-progress commissioning attempt; the PASE layer sends `InvalidParameter` to avoid a 60-second device lockout
    - Enhancement: Several enhancements around session management when nodes reconnect or new sessions get pushed by the device
    - Enhancement: Several enhancements around OTA updates and transfers, also when nodes restart in the middle of the process
    - Enhancement: Add Product-Info API to VendorInfoService to expose DCL information for a given VendorId and ProductId
    - Enhancement: Probes discovered addresses and potentially updates session addresses when they change even when we have a valid working session
    - Enhancement: Optimizes operational connection logic during commissioning when multiple IPs are discovered
    - Enhancement: Uses a minimum of 60 seconds for thread/wifi network scan or connect timeouts even if devices announce lower values
    - Enhancement: WiFi/Thread network scan failures are no longer fatal during commissioning; scan failures are logged as warnings
    - Enhancement: Buffers storage of client state changes for up to 20 minutes to reduce I/O pressure
    - Adjustment: No longer ignores overly long incoming Matter messages, but still logs a warning
    - Adjustment: Tolerate operational certificates with 21-octet serial numbers (spec limit is 20, but seen in the wild with some LG TVs) and log a warning; longer serial numbers are still rejected
    - Adjustment: Refactor MdnsClient to also use the new DNS-SD-names logic
    - Fix: Ensure the incoming order of attribute changes is preserved when processing them even though no one should rely on any order
    - Fix: Better handle errors when the BLE connection is disconnected during a write action
    - Fix: Ensures that multiple discovered devices are tried when PASE establishment to the first device fails (e.g., because of a wrong passcode)
    - Fix: Do not announce devices as commissionable before the factory reset when the last fabric is removed
    - Fix: Fixes expiry logic where cached records for Commissionable devices could potentially never expire
    - Fix: For BDX cases also give the device the defined timeout of 5 minutes to ack/request the next packet
    - Fix: Accept SecureChannel StatusReport messages on any protocol exchange (e.g. BDX)
    - Fix: Ensures the Matter port on IPv4 is the same as on IPv6

- @matter/react-native
    - Breaking: We updated to @react-native-async-storage/async-storage v3. A v2-compatible class is available. See the package readme.

- @matter/tools
    - Breaking: This package is no longer published and replaced in internal usage

- @matter/types
    - Breaking: We have removed the deprecated device type definitions in DeviceTypes that have not received updates since Matter 1.1
    - Breaking: A number of semi-internal implementation details of cluster metadata have changed.  The general API shape remains the same but some advanced use cases may require updates
    - Breaking: Removed some special pre-bound TLV string/byte-string schema exports, including `TlvHardwareAddress`
    - Feature: We've rewritten the typing system for clusters to simplify types, consume less runtime memory and work better with IDEs
    - Enhancement: Increases Matter TlvString/TlvByteString default maximum length to 65536 to cover WebRTC cases
    - Fix: `NodeId.fromGroupId` now produces a full 16-hex Group Node ID per Matter spec
    - Fix: (@snabb) `TlvTaggedList` now ensures schema/tag ordering when encoding (Matter Core §10.6.1). Added `TlvTaggedListPreservingOrder` for cases where ordering needs to be data driven (e.g. signed certificate sub-lists).

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Feature: CommissioningController allows to set `tcp` (boolean) to enable TCP support for the controller
    - Feature: CommissioningController allows to set `transportPreference` ("udp"/"tcp") to define the preferred connection type when devices support both. "udp" is the default and fallback
    - Feature: CommissioningOptions when commission a new device allows to set an `onAttestationFailure` callback that gets called with attestation validation options and allows decisions to continue or block the commissioning. Default accepts but logs all failures.
    - Enhancement: `CommissioningController.commissionNode()` now uses the parallel PASE commissioning path for pre-discovered devices; WiFi/Thread/regulatory credentials and abort signal are fully propagated
    - Enhancement: Legacy `Endpoint` and `PairedNode` wrappers expose `featuresOf()` / `maybeFeaturesOf()` and `globalsOf()` / `maybeGlobalsOf()` matching the modern client endpoint
    - Enhancement: Legacy `Endpoint` and `PairedNode` wrappers now also expose `get()`, `getStateOf()`, `eventsOf()`, `maybeStateOf()` and string-id overloads on existing accessors for parity with the modern client endpoint
    - Adjustment: The "Waiting for device discovery" node state is now bound to the availability of IP announcements from MDNS
    - Fix: Fixes inverted autoConnect logic in CommissioningController

## 0.16.0 (2026-01-12)

- Breaking: matter.js now requires node.js 20.19+ or 22.13+ or 24.0+ (LTS versions). Node.js 18.x is no longer supported.
- Breaking: Because of the upgrade to TypeScript 5.9, all usages of Uint8Array were changed to use a more convenient own type alias Bytes
- Breaking: Matter 1.4.2 no longer specifies reasonable defaults for many fields, so you may find new places where you need to manually supply an attribute value
- Breaking: The default Node.js storage manager (`StorageBackendDisk`) was optimized for performance which requires not opening multiple storages for the same ID at the same time. So check your usage of `StorageService`, if you use it directly too.

- @matter/\*:
    - Upgraded to Matter specification version 1.4.2

- @matter/examples
    - Breaking: This package is no longer published. The examples are moved in the repository into the `examples/` directory. Simply use the project creator `npm init @matter` to create a new project based on one of the examples.

- @matter/general
    - Breaking: Our time API is upgraded, most notably with proper typing for time intervals. This makes time handling more consistent and safer, but it does change how you convey intervals to matter.js. For example: `delay: Seconds(1)` rather than `delayMs: 1000`.
    - Breaking: There are other small time changes such as converting `nowMs()` (a function) to `nowMs` (a property).
    - Breaking: SyncStorage interface got removed
    - Breaking: MaybeAsyncStorage got renamed to Storage because it is the only interface from now on
    - Breaking: Some central services, especially MdnsService, are now tracked automatically by usages and will close correctly when no longer needed. Closing MdnsService manually is not needed anymore.
    - Breaking: The types for observables with synchronous emitters no longer accept async observers.  Most observables are async but if you encounter a type error you need to track your promise outside the observable
    - Feature: Adds Blob support to the Storage interface
    - Feature: Add BDX (Bulk Data eXchange) protocol support according to Matter specification
    - Feature: Added support for multiple hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, SHA3-256) via HashAlgorithm enum with IANA identifiers
    - Enhancement: Enhanced Crypto.computeHash() to support streaming data via ReadableStreamDefaultReader and AsyncIterator in addition to Bytes and Bytes[] for memory-efficient hash computation
    - Enhancement: Added platform abstractions for of HTTP, WebSockets, and MQTT
    - Enhancement: Added polyfills and additional types for decorators
    - Enhancement: Split out access to random values from the Crypto interface to an Entropy interface
    - Enhancement: Added support for shared Environment services by tracking usages and closing when the last user is gone
    - Enhancement: Specializes `camelize()` to stop processing when $ is reached to better handle special names for custom clusters
    - Enhancement: Convert PromiseQueue to Semaphore with the obtain / release approach
    - Enhancement: Update Session timing parameters during CASE/PASE as delivered by the peer already during session establishments
    - Fix: Ensures that StandaloneAck messages are always considering the corresponding Secure channel protocol ID

- @matter/model
    - Feature: You can now use Ecma TC39 stage 3 decorators to associate assign Matter semantics to JavaScript classes
    - Feature: You can now reference subproperties in constraints as required by Matter 1.4.2
    - Feature: Constraints now support Matter 1.4.2 functions `minOf` and `maxOf`
    - Enhancement: Model API is improved to simplify element filtering based on conformance

- @matter/node
    - Breaking: `Endpoint` and `Node` initialization values now require the correct type for some time values and IDs. So for example, `VendorId(1234)` instead of just `1234`
    - Breaking: `SubscriptionBehavior` is renamed to `SubscriptionsServer` with corresponding ID change to "subscriptions". This means in part that matter.js will ignore saved subscriptions, but devices will recreate them automatically
    - Breaking: The `agentFor` method of `ActionContext` has moved to `Endpoint`. You likely do not use this directly but if you do you must change `context.agentFor(endpoint)` to `endpoint.agentFor(context)`
    - Breaking: We have refactored the `ActionContext` class to better delineate fields that apply to operations triggered locally vs those triggered by authenticated peers. `ActionContext` may be a `RemoteActorContext` or `LocalActorContext`. You can determine the actor type and access relevant fields using new type guards `hasRemoteActor` or `hasLocalActor` and new type assertion `assertRemoteActor`. These replace the former `offline` field of `ActionContext`
    - Breaking: The `FabricAction` enum emitted by CommissioningServer is replaced with a simple string type
    - Feature: matter.js now natively supports remote access to Matter nodes via non-Matter protocols. You can add `HttpServer`, `WebSocketServer` and/or `MqttServer` to your `ServerNode` to enable HTTP, WebSocket, and MQTT access respectively
    - Feature: You can now use Ecma TC39 stage 3 decorators to customize the schema associated with a `Behavior` implementation
    - Feature: New `StateStream` component offers a high-level API for monitoring changes across multiple nodes
    - Feature: Add default implementation for the `Thermostat` cluster according to Matter 1.4.2 specification. All features except MSCH and SB (which is considered provisional) are implemented. See the `ThermostatServer` class for details.
    - Feature: Added feature complete default implementation for the `Scenes Management` cluster according to Matter 1.4.2 specification.
    - Feature: Added the VendorIdVerification algorithm on device side according to Matter 1.4.2 specification. Controller side is only partially implemented yet.
    - Feature: Added default implementations for OtaSoftwareUpdateRequestor/Provider clusters according to Matter specification.
    - Feature: Added OTA management support component (SoftwareUpdateManager)
    - Enhancement: Adds "maybeReactTo" which only registers the listener when the event exists.
    - Enhancement: Enhances Endpoint#eventsOf and Endpoint#setStateOf with overrides so you can use the ID to obtain variants with generic typing
    - Enhancement: We now enforce bounds for integer types even if not specified explicitly by constraint
    - Enhancement: Also allow to use the `Endpoint#set()` method with attribute ids instead of attributeNames
    - Fix: Ensures that the InLevel does not interfere with *WithOnOff commands in the Level Control cluster
    - Fix: Ensures correct behavior for announcements and fabric table updates in case of updating fabrics

- @matter/nodejs
    - Breaking: The default storage manager (`StorageBackendDisk`) was optimized for performance which requires not opening multiple storages for the same ID at the same time. So check your usage of `StorageService`, if you use it directly too.
    - Enhancement: Uses "stat" to determine storage file existence instead of reading all content
    - Enhancement: Exposes Node's native HTTP server via new abstractions in `@matter/general`
    - Fix: Corrects network interface selection logic for windows

- @matter/nodejs-ble
  - Fix: Updating Noble and Bleno to enhance compatibility on macOS and Windows

    - Feature: Added `cert` command for DCL certificate management with subcommands: list, details, as-pem, delete, and update
    - Feature: Added `ota` command for OTA update management with subcommands: info, extract, verify, list, add, delete, and copy for managing OTA image files in storage
    - Feature: Added new commands to the `node` commands to check, download and apply OTA updates for nodes

- @matter/protocol
    - Breaking: The platform-specific BLE abstraction has changed so that higher-level logic may be shared across platforms
    - Breaking: Low-level advertising APIs have changed significantly; in particular, `MdnsBroadcaster`, `MdnsInstanceBroadcaster` and `MdnsScanner` are replaced by `MdnsServer`, `MdnsAdvertisement` and `MdnsClient`
    - Breaking: The `Ble.get()` singleton is removed; components now instead retrieve the `Ble` service from the environment
    - Breaking: Moved some controller API classes (Attribute/Event/Command/InteractionClient) into @project-chip/matter.js/cluster package and adjusted to use Node Interactable as backing
    - Breaking: Reading multiple/all attributes via `InteractionClient` is always reading the data from the device and no longer enrich the result with already known data (option `enrichCachedAttributeData` is no longer supported). Ideally, use ClusterClient or new Node-based APIs to access the already stored data.
    - Feature: Adds support for advertising of TCP and ICD services (but matter.js does not yet implement those features otherwise)
    - Feature: Adds support for extended advertisement
    - Feature: Added support for Case Authenticated Tags (CATs) in operational CASE sessions for enhanced access control
    - Feature: Added support to read and parse ASN.1 formatted certificates
    - Feature: Added DclCertificateService for managing Product Attestation Authority (PAA) certificates from the Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL) with automatic updates from production DCL, test DCL, and GitHub development repositories
    - Feature: Added DclOtaUpdateService for checking and downloading Over-The-Air (OTA) software updates from DCL with full validation and checksum verification
    - Feature: Added DclVendorInfoService for retrieving vendor information from DCL
    - Feature: Added OTA image processing utilities (OtaImageReader, OtaImageWriter) for reading, validating, extracting, and creating Matter OTA update files
    - Feature: (@ArtemisMucaj) Added support to pass / generate an intermediate CA in the CertificateAuthority class, when used the NOCs are signed with the ICAC cert
    - Enhancement: (@bhargavnagotha9) Allows the Root keypair to be optional when ICAC is provided
    - Enhancement: MDNS broadcasts more aggressively until a connection is established
    - Enhancement: MDNS and BLE advertising schedules are now configurable and conform to Matter and DNS-SD specifications
    - Enhancement: MDNS client and server efficiency is improved with a shared socket and message parser
    - Enhancement: MDNS Truncated Queries are now handled correctly
    - Enhancement: matter.js no longer uses SO_REUSEADDR on the Matter port, so you can no longer accidentally start two nodes at the same address simultaneously
    - Enhancement: Increases the limitation of parallel exchanges when sending messages to 30 (was 5 before)
    - Enhancement: Migrate Commissioning Flow to ClientInteraction as bases
    - Enhancement: FabricAuthority automatically rotates the operational Fabric NOC key pair on start once (for Controller cases)
    - Adjustment: Subscription data are no longer being flushed when a subscription is replaced by a new one with keepSubscriptions=false
    - Adjustment: When setting certificates and a ICAC is provided but equals the root CA, the ICAC is ignored (workaround of issues with one ecosystem)
    - Fix: Controller networking was previously throwing the incorrect error after a communication timeout
    - Fix: Ensures to only include the MaxTcpMessageSize in Session parameters when TCP is enabled
    - Fix: Fixes the used ACL level for wildcard writes
    - Fix: (@ArtemisMucaj) Fixes noc trust chain verification; verify against both RCAC and ICAC if present

- @matter/react-native
    - Fix: (@Luxni) Update UDP, BLE, and Crypto usage to work with React Native

- @matter/types
    - Breaking: All "epoch-s" and "epoch-us" values are now converted automatically to the correct matter epoch, so that your own code can just use normal 1970-based epochS/US values. If you converted yourself to the Matter 2000-based values before, please remove this conversion.
    - Enhancement: The duplicate event priority definition `EventPriority` is deprecated; use the generated `Priority` enum instead
    - Fix: Ensures correct Number ranges for nullable and non-nullable numbers on TLV level

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Breaking: `PairedNode.state` renamed to `PairedNode.connectionState`!
    - Breaking: PairedNode attribute change callbacks and events does _not_ contain the `changed` and `oldValue` properties anymore
    - Breaking: Some PairedNode API methods got slightly reduced in functionality, but that should not affect most users
    - Breaking: The Storage location of the controller base data has moved. The data will be migrated automatically on the first start of the new version (be aware, this can take some seconds!)
        - Cached node attribute data (formerly `node-<ID>.*` in the main storage) are now located in `nodes.peerX.endpoints.*` because they are now managed
        - The fabric (formerly "credentials.fabric") is now located at "fabrics.*"
        - The certificates (formerly other `credentials.*`) are now located in `certificates.*`
        - The list of commissioned nodes (formerly "nodes.commissionedNodes") is now integrated in the node peer data (nodes.peerX)
    - Feature: Added new option `enableOtaProvider` to `CommissioningControllerOptions` to enable OTA Provider functionality
    - Enhancement: The PairedNode is data wise now backend by a ServerNode instance which acts as controller and provides all data management and peer access. This API can alredy be moved directly by using `PairedNode.node` - some convenience methods are also dorectly mapped on the PairedNode itself (see below). initial connection and reconnection management is still handled by PairedNode and will move later.
    - Enhancement: Added more convenient accessors for endpoint cached read-only state: `Endpoint.state` property for attributes for all clusters in generic way and `Endpoint.stateOf()` for typed access for a defined Client behavior
    - Enhancement: Added more convenient accessors for endpoint commands: `Endpoint.commands` property for commands for all clusters in generic way and `Endpoint.commandsOf()` for a types access for a defined Client behavior
    - Enhancement: Added `PairedNode.parts` and `Endpoint.parts` as Map property to access all endpoints of a node
    - Enhancement: Added `PairedNode.state`, `PairedNode.stateOf()`, `PairedNode.commands` and `PairedNode.commandsOf()` to access all endpoints of te root endpoint in a more convenient way

- @matter/mqtt
    - Feature: New package implementing `@matter/main` MQTT abstraction using MQTT.js

## 0.13.0 (2025-04-28)

- NOTE: This version is compatible with Node.js 20.x, 22.x, and 24.x. Node.js 18.x might be unsupported for BLE if installed before 20.05.2025 because the BLE libraries we use (noble/bleno) were temporarily only compatible with Node.js 20+. This is fixed for bleno >= 0.11.4 and noble >= 2.3.1.

- IMPORTANT: This release upgrades Matter support from Matter 1.3 to the latest release, Matter 1.4.0. This includes BREAKING CHANGES in a number of areas due to specification changes. For the most part these changes are transparent because they involve low-level APIs, implicit type names, or Matter features that were never adopted elsewhere. However, some small code changes may be necessary depending on how you use Matter.js or when Datatypes or elements got renamed.
    - Especially please note that `colorTempPhysicalMinMireds` and `colorTempPhysicalMaxMireds` now need to be set when using ColorControl because the former unrealistic default values were removed from the specification. Please set proper values for your device Hint: realistic color temperature Mireds values are usually roughly between 150 (6500K) and 500 (2000K).
    - Also note the new cluster revision 5 for the OccupancySensing cluster which requires you to use feature flags, and also some attributes have changed behavior or got deprecated. We added logic that automatically fills the attributes occupancySensorTypeBitmap and occupancySensorType with the values according to the enabled features if needed.

- chip-testing
    - Feature: Added Chip-Tool compatible WebSocket Controller implementation to also run interop tests with matter.js controller
    - Feature: Added Docker based own Test Runner and execute all tests there too with chip-tool against matter.js test device

- @matter/examples
    - Enhancement: Added Robotic Vacuum Cleaner example to show the cluster dependencies and basic logic requirements
    - Enhancement: Added Air Quality Sensor example

- @matter/general
    - Breaking: `Logger.logger` is replaced with `Logger.destinations`. Properties of individual destinations are slightly different. A deprecated compatibility API should make this largely transparent
    - Feature: Logging destinations may process `Diagnostic.Message` directly and bypass matter.js formatting
    - Feature: Log formatting is now extensible with custom formats
    - Feature: `QuietObservable` is an extended event source that emits events at reduced frequency based on configuration
    - Enhancement: Formalized concept of a logging "destination" and converted API for managing destinations to a simple object interface
    - Enhancement: Modifying log levels and format using the `Logger` static interface now updates defaults and applies changes to all destinations
    - Enhancement: Transaction participants no longer need to implement commit-related methods if they do not participate in persistence
    - Enhancement: Missing IPv4 addresses on network interfaces are now ignored even if IPv4 is not disabled via configuration
    - Fix: Correctly handle MDNS records without QNames

- @matter/main
    - Feature: Automatically handle basicInformation uniqueId Property as defined by specification if not set by the developer

- @matter/node
    - Breaking: The Default `OnOffServer` implementation no longer has the "Lighting" feature enabled by default! Please enable manually when the relevant device type where the cluster is used in requires it or use the Requirement-classes like `OnOffLightRequirements.OnOffServer` to get the correct features enabled automatically.
    - Breaking: The Default `LevelControlServer` implementation no longer has the "OnOff" feature enabled by default! Please enable manually when the relevant device type where the cluster is used in requires it or use the Requirement-classes like `DimmedLightRequirements.LevelControlServer` to get the correct features enabled automatically.
    - Breaking: `LevelControlServer` API has a few small changes that may affect device implementors. Most notably the `setLevel` method is replaced with `transition` which handles both immediate and gradual level shifts
    - Breaking: Removed Implementation Logic for the "AbsolutePosition" Feature in WindowCovering default implementation because this is a forbidden (Zigbee) Feature anyway that no-one should use!
    - Breaking: The DoorLock cluster attribute `supportedOperatingModes` bitmap requires clearing bits for supported modes. To allow to set this bitmap correctly we added a helper bit-range `alwaysSet` (with value 2047) to set the unused bits. Please make sure to set the correct bits for your device according to the specification meaning.
    - Breaking: All default implementations now are async (as before if needed) or expose as MaybePromise to allow async or sync overriding. Ideally this does not change anything for custom implementations but checks for returned promises when calling "super" methods.
    - Feature: `Transitions` utility class offers a flexible API for implementing Matter attributes that change gradually at a constant rate
    - Feature: Attributes marked as `Q` (quieter) quality now support an extended `quiet` property that controls how often and when they emit. By default `Q` attributes emit once per second
    - Feature: `LevelControlServer` and `ColorControlServer` performs smoother transitions with configurable transition step sizes and Matter 1.4-compliant event emitting. It offers several new extension points for integrating with hardware and bridged devices
    - Feature: Added support for the ActionSwitch feature for the `SwitchServer` default implementation
    - Feature: Added basic validation for all ModeBase derived \*Mode clusters
    - Feature: Added basic validation for OperationalState and derived \*OperationalState clusters
    - Feature: Added basic validation and logic for the ServiceArea cluster
    - Enhancement: `OccupancySensingServer` is automatically filling some legacy attributes when features are correctly set as required by new revision 5 of the cluster
    - Enhancement: Event handling has received additional formality. The node now ensures that async handlers register as tasks with the node. Error logging contains more detail on the source of errors
    - Enhancement: `$Changed` events now run in a separate context from the emitter and errors will not interfere with the emitter
    - Fix: Switched "boot time" to be the time the node comes online instead of the time the OS started
    - Fix: Fixed patching of arrays to correctly allow setting arrays with fewer elements than the original array using `set()`

- @matter/nodejs
    - Breaking: The StorageBackendDisk class got removed, including the "node-localstorage" dependency, but the name got reused and so the "StorageBackendDiskAsync" is now "StorageBackendDisk".
    - Enhancement: Added a UDP send guard to reject hanging send calls after maximum 1-2s
    - Fix: Improves async storage reliability and error handling to prevent empty storage files in crashing edge cases. With this change write actions need longer a bit but are more reliable, which mainly affects controller use cases when persisting the device attribute data on the first subscription
    - Fix: Also accept incoming UDP traffic from unknown network interfaces for Matter messages

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Enhancement: Upgraded Noble and Bleno and optimized stability with BLE device and controller operations

    - Fix: Prevents crash on startup when having set a Fabric label in config

- @matter/protocol
    - Breaking: `updateReceived()` callback on subscriptions is triggered after all updated data events are sent out.
    - Feature: Enhanced `getMultipleAttributesAndEvents()` to also return attributeStatus and eventStatus properties with errors returned from the read interaction
    - Feature: Added `getMultipleAttributesAndStatus()` and `getMultipleEventsAndStatus()` to InteractionClient to allow also returning attribute and event errors from the read interaction
    - Enhancement: Allows accessing attributes, events, and commands in CLusterClient instances also by their ID.
    - Enhancement: Makes sure that the Node ID for commissioning of a new node is not already commissioned.
    - Enhancement: Returns the maximum interval in seconds when InteractionClient is used to establish a subscription
    - Fix: Makes sure to not Forward StatusResponseError cases that we generate locally to the device when not wanted
    - Fix: Enhances checks for Wi-Fi/Thread credentials in config for CommissioningFlow
    - Fix: Ensures that PASE establishments are guarded as defined by specification to prevent passcode brute force attacks
    - Fix: Informs the device when Controller cancels pairing because of a wrong passcode to allow direct retries

- @project-chip/matter.js
    - Breaking: Reduced exports to the relevant one for Controller usage. Please use @matter/main for the rest.
    - Breaking: Remove the Legacy Device building API. Please use the new SeverNode-based API, which is more flexible and powerful.
    - Breaking: Changed signatures of `commissionNode()` and `createInteractionClient()` to provide options as object and not plain parameters
    - Breaking: The handling of the `requestFromRemote` parameter (first parameter) in get\*Attribute methods in ClusterClients changed behavior! providing "false" will now never try to read from remote, "true" will always try to read from remote and "undefined" will use the default behavior (read from remote if not available locally or fabric scoped read). Only relevant if you used this parameter with the value "false". Other use cases stay unchanged.
    - Feature: Allows using a custom Root-NodeId, CertificateAuthority, or CommissioningFlow implementation in the Controller
    - Feature: Allows establishing a secure PASE session to a device and use this to interact with the device in special pre-commissioning cases.
    - Enhancement: Exposing the current Subscription Interval on `PairedNode::currentSubscriptionIntervalSeconds()
    - Enhancement: Adjusted the initial Device connection to Read-All before subscribing to also have initial values for not-changed attributes
    - Enhancement: Added new PairedNode event `connectionAlive` to expose the subscription-alive triggers (on changes or after max interval)
    - Fix: Fixes an edge case in reconnection handling

- @project-chip/\* packages (beside above)
    - Breaking: Packages are removed! Please use the new packages under @matter/\* if needed

## 0.11.0 (2024-10-29)

- IMPORTANT: As of 0.10.0 the @project-chip/matter.js module has grown quite large. This release includes major refactoring that moves functional areas into independent NPM packages under the "@matter" org. We have added exports to maintain backwards compatibility but these are not exhaustive. In some cases you may need to update imports to reference new code locations.

- Cross-module changes
    - Info: Matter.js now uses aliases via `package.json` "imports" field. This is an internal change that simplifies imports but should not affect consumers
    - Info: Previously we used a mix of a snake-case and CamelCase for sub-package exports. We have now standardized on snake case. Compatibility packages (see below) continue to support the original module names

- @matter/general:
    - Info: General functionality that is not Matter specific previously resided in `@project-chip/matter.js`. It now lives in `@matter/general`
    - BREAKING: The "ByteArray" type is removed, replaced with native-JS Uint8Array and a small collection of utility functions in the "Bytes" namespace
    - Feature: The default "Time" implementation is now fully functional across all standard JS runtimes
    - Enhancement: Network transports can now self-select which the protocols and addresses they support
    - Feature: A new `ObserverGroup` class simplifies binding management for multiple observables
    - Feature: Introduced a new Async Disk key/Value-Storage compatible with the sync one driven by node-localstorage and uses it by default in new API and controller instances

- @matter/main:
    - Info: This package is a new "one-and-done" dependency for applications. It automatically loads platform specialization and reexports packages above as appropriate

- @matter/model:
    - Info: The Matter object model previously exported as `@project-chip/matter.js/model` now resides in `@matter/model`
    - Info: Individual elements exported by name are now models (fully functional classes) rather than elements (raw JSON data). This should be backwards compatible but makes them more useful operationally

- @matter/node:
    - Info: The high-level APIs previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now reside in `@matter/node`. The Node API includes node management, behavior definitions, and endpoint definitions
    - Info: We export behaviors under `@matter/node/behaviors` or individually (e.g. `@matter/node/behaviors/on-off`)
    - Info: We export device type definitions for system endpoints and devices under `@matter/node/endpoints` and `@matter/node/devices` respectively. You may also import these via index or individually

- @matter/nodejs:
    - Info: Node.js specialization is moved here. `@project-chip/matter-node.js` remains as a compatibility import.
    - BREAKING: The previously deprecated re-exports in matter-node.js from matter.js are removed.

- @matter/nodejs-ble
    - Info: The BLE specialization for Node.js is moved here. `@project-chip/matter-node-ble.js` remains as a compatibility import.
    - Info: The noble and bleno dependencies got updated to also support Ubuntu 24

- @matter/nodejs-shell:
    - Breaking: The Shell Storage was moved to the new approach. Please use "--legacyStorage" on startup to connect with the old storage to get into your old shell history and commissioned devices. Storage migration guide see in the [README.md](./packages/nodejs-shell/README.md#matterjs-v011-storage-adjustment).
    - Feature: Added new shell command "tlv" with TLV decoding and structure logging tooling
    - Enhancement: Added an option to specify if attributes are loaded from remote or locally
    - Enhancement: The shell now saves a 100 history of commands and restores this on startup
    - Enhancement: Add a "nodes status" command to show the status of all nodes

- @matter/protocol:
    - Info: Low-level Matter logic previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now resides in `@matter/protocol`. This includes network communication, fabric management and cluster invocation, read/write, events, etc.
    - BREAKING: Various types that were previously specialized with template parameters are no longer generic. This should be largely transparent to API consumers. Compatibility exports still support the generic parameters in some, but not all, cases.
    - BREAKING: We have done some reorganization of lower-level implementation classes to improve implementation flexibility. You probably do not use these classes directly so will be unaffected.
    - Feature: New functional components including `DeviceCommissioner`, `DeviceAdvertiser`, `NodeFinder` and `Subscription` now perform functions that previously were in the (deprecated) MatterDevice class
    - Enhancement: To simplify low-level configuration, many components in the protocol module now optionally retrieve dependencies from an Environment
    - Enhancement: Limits the number of parallel exchanges to 5
    - Enhancement: Uses the session timing details to calculate the timeout for subscription messages when received as client additionally to the subscription maxInterval
    - Enhancement: Internal restructuring of Controller logic and setup. Introducing "peers" (commissioned node on a shared fabric)
    - Fix: When subscribing with keepSubscriptions === false, the existing subscriptions need to be removed earlier in the flow
    - Fix: Clear resumption records also when fabric gets updated or deleted

- @matter/types:
    - Info: Various definitions previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now reside in `@matter/types`. This includes most TLV structures, cluster definitions, and various support types
    - Info: Clusters are not exported in `@project-chip/matter.js`. You can import via `@project-chip/types/clusters` or individually (e.g. `@project-chip/types/clusters/window-covering`)

- @matter/examples:
    - Enhancement: Adds a new example to show a PlugIn-Socket with Energy and Power measurement

- @matter/cli-tool:
    - Feature: This new package offers a specialized JS environment for interacting with Matter and matter.js
    - The "matter" command supports standard JS syntax and a "shell" style syntax that emulates common shell commands
    - The virtual filesystem exposed by the tool allows you to navigate matter.js packages and active subsystems
    - This is an alpha feature. We'll add command line control and additional functionality over time

- @matter/create
    - Feature: This new package bootstraps matter.js-based projects.
    - For usage run `npm init @matter help` anywhere you have Node.js installed

- Matter-Core functionality:
    - Enhancement: Allow discovering VendorId + ProductId together optionally

- matter.js clusters:
    - Adds convenience helper method for ElectricalEnergyMeasurement cluster (for usage, see new example MeasuredSocketDevice) to set measurements and also trigger the necessary events when imported and exported values changed in the measurement and events are required by specification
- matter.js Controller API:
    - Breaking: PairedNode instances are now created and directly returned also when the node is not et connected. This do not block code flows anymore for offline devices
    - Breaking: Because of this, "getConnectedNode()" got renamed to "getPairedNode()"
    - Breaking: "nodeState" property on PairedNode got renamed to "state"
    - Breaking: Removed SupportedEventClient and UnknownSupportedEventClient and replaced by EventClient because EventList is provisional and was removed now (was not working for many devices anyway)
    - Breaking: Removed ClusterClient methods isEventSupported and isEventSupportedByName because event lists are no longer available
    - Deprecation: The attributeChangedCallback, eventTriggeredCallback, and nodeStateChangedCallbacks are deprecated and replaced by new events "attributeChanged", "eventTriggered" and "stateChanged", "structureChanged" and "decommissioned" on PairedNode
    - Feature: Some more data (like Network interfaces, PowerSources, Thread details) are collected and used when connecting to the nodes
    - Feature: Based on a device type the minimum and maximum subscription interval is now automatically set based on certain best practices. When multiple nodes are subscribed, all Thread-based devices are initialized by a "4 in parallel queue" to limit the used thread bandwidth.
    - Feature: Subscribed attribute data are cached for each node and used on reconnections by using dataVersionFilters on read and subscribes to reduce bandwidth on reconnections. The data are not (yet) persisted, so after Controller restarts, the data is collected anew.
    - Feature: Low-level InteractionClient API allows enriching the attribute data that are not returned because of dataVersionFilters.
    - Feature: Properly announces the controller node on start for devices to find the controller if needed and to use persisted subscriptions on the device side
    - Enhancement: Only recreate PairedNode internal objects when the structure really changed also on reconnections.
    - Enhancement: Utilize more information (beside partList changes now also feature, serverList, attributeList, generatedCommandLists) as the structure changes to reinitialize objects.
    - Enhancement: Huge refactoring in internal logic, optimized reconnection, and rediscovery

## 0.10.7 (2024-11-07)

## 0.10.0 (2024-08-31)

- IMPORTANT: This release upgrades Matter support from Matter 1.1 to the latest release, Matter 1.3.0.1. This includes BREAKING CHANGES in a number of areas due to specification changes and some improvements in how we define datatypes. For the most part these changes are transparent because they involve low-level APIs, implicit type names, or Matter features that were never adopted elsewhere. However, some small code changes may be necessary depending on how you use Matter.js.

- Matter.js Parser and Code generator:
    - Feature: We now generate all Matter datatypes and elements. This includes some we defined by hand previously and those introduced by the Matter 1.2 and Matter 1.3 specifications.
    - Feature: We now generate some datatypes that are not officially global or part of a specific cluster but are nevertheless defined in Matter specifications.
    - Enhancement: Expanded dialect for conformance, constraint and "other quality" DSLs.
    - Enhancement: Includes numerous code generation improvements.
- Matter.js Matter Definition, Clusters, Schemas, and Device-Types (independent of the used API)
    - Breaking: Cluster revisions have increased and there are new mandatory elements for a few clusters. We have implemented these in places where we provide non-skeletal cluster implementations.
    - Breaking: Previously we generated redundant definitions for struct, enum, and bitmap types in *Interface.ts and *Cluster.ts files. We've eliminated those in the interface files.
    - Breaking: Previously we generated redundant TLV and types for datatypes used by multiple clusters. We now only provide these types in their canonical location (globally or in the `ClusterName` namespace for the base cluster).
    - Breaking: Some datatype names have changed to align with changes in the Matter specification and to make names more logical.
    - Breaking: We've removed a few deprecated definitions for unused Matter elements such as the Scenes cluster.
    - Breaking: Globals.ts previously defined core datatypes for the Matter object model. These are now generated and individually importable.
    - Breaking: We've removed a few old draft datatypes defined in [connectedhomeip](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) that were abandoned, renamed, or are still "draft" as of Matter 1.3.
    - Breaking: Some types related to ClusterServer are simplified. This should be largely transparent but the template arguments are slightly different
    - Feature: Adds all elements (clusters, attributes, events, commands, device types, and datatypes) introduced in Matter 1.2 and Matter 1.3.
    - Feature: Adds all Standard Namespaces defined by Matter 1.3
- Matter-Core functionality:
    - Breaking: Removes the discovery capability "softAccessPoint" as it was removed from the Matter specification
    - Breaking: Matter.js now requires node.js 18+
    - Breaking: We now target ES 2022 for transpiled output. We have not adopted new language features but this does mean that we generate true class properties now
    - Breaking: We've removed the APIs `tryCatch` and `tryCatchAsync`. These were used internally -- not part of any Matter related API -- but were exported
    - Feature: Increase Data Model revision to 17 (introduced by Matter 1.2)
    - Feature: Added Base64 encoding/decoding support to ByteArray
    - Feature: Added WildcardPathFlagsBitmap to Attribute expansion for read/subscribe Interactions
    - Feature: Added Matter 1.3 session params
    - Feature: Added support for Multi-Invokes for Matter 1.3 (default for now are 10 invokes till we have a better value)
    - Enhancement: Update Session parameters in PASE/CASE to match Matter 1.3 specification
    - Enhancement: Removes TCP and ICD TXT records from MDNS responses because both currently not supported and optional to reduce the size of the MDNS responses
    - Enhancement: Adds encoding and decoding of custom TlvData in QR-Codes including extensible Schema support for the defined Matter fields
    - Enhancement: Optimizes Read and Subscribe handling for clients/controller to better match with specification
    - Enhancement: Adds encoding/decoding support for multiple device information in one QR-Code
    - Enhancement: Makes processing of manual Pairing codes more robust directly on decoding level
    - Enhancement: Refactored Message size handling to dynamically calculate payload size based on transport capabilities
    - Enhancement: Refactored and cleanup CASE and PASE and corrected handling in some places
    - Enhancement: Added BTP Idle timeout as defined in Matter specification
    - Enhancement: Enhanced default implementation of GeneralDiagnostics cluster with new convenience methods
    - Enhancement: Many more protocol and functionality syncs with matter specification 1.3
    - Enhancement: The Network methods that handles NetworkInterfaces are now "MaybePromise" to allow async implementations
    - Enhancement/Fix: Several fixes and optimizations in Session and Message Exchange handling
    - Enhancement/Fix: Adjusted MRP behavior with chip and only use/expect MRP ion unreliable channels (UDP). Fixes BLE commissioning
    - Fix: Adjusted ValidationErrors to be more specific if they should return "InvalidAction" ot "ConstraintError".
    - Fix: Adjusted some returned errors to be more specific and to the specification (e.g. InvalidAction instead of Failure)
    - Fix: Fixed StandaloneAck handling to use an outstanding ack number as piggybacked ack number
    - Fix: Makes sure subscription maxInterval cannot exceed the matter defined maximum of 60mins
    - Fix: Synced attMtu handling with chip to always use MTU-3 bytes for BLE connections
- matter.js API:
    - Breaking: Node.start() is now asynchronous and returns when the node is online. This is only breaking in that lack of await will result in an unhandled rejection. Node.bringOnline() is deprecated.
    - Feature: Adds default implementations for i18n clusters including Localization, Time Format Localization, and Unit Localization.
    - Feature: Adds interactionBegin and interactionEnd events for ClusterBehaviors to demarcate online interactions that mutate state.
    - Feature: Any state value defined with schema is now configurable via the environment.
    - Feature: You may now mark endpoints as "non-essential" to prevent errors from incapacitating a node.
    - Feature: Utility device types are added automatically to the endpoints when the relevant clusters (like PowerSource or ElectricalSensor) are existing on the endpoint
    - Feature: Adds DescriptorServer#addTag to make adding tags more convenient
    - Feature: Modifies DescriptorServer#addDeviceType to accept device type name to simplify avoidance of cyclical dependencies
    - Enhancement: Various Endpoint methods throw the root cause when there is an error rather than logging the root cause and throwing a less descriptive error.
    - Enhancement: Explicitly defines DescriptorServer as an endpoint requirement so attributes are configurable in TS directly
- matter.js Controller API:
    - Breaking: commissionNode() in CommissioningController now returns the Node-ID and not the PairedNode instance.
    - Breaking: AttributeClient now throws an exception when an attribute should be subscribed which is not reporting updates via subscriptions
    - Feature: Adds PaseCommissioner to allow to execute the initial (PASE based) commissioning process separately from the operational completion of the commissioning process, also allowed to be BLE only.
    - Feature: Allows to complete the commissioning process for a node where this process was started by a PASE commissioner
    - Feature: Allows to commission a node without directly connecting to it
    - Enhancement: Always read attributes that do not report changes via subscriptions (including all unknown Attributes)
    - Fix: Skips network commissioning during commissioning when the commissioning is already using an IP based channel (like UDP)
    - Fix: Fixes Node reconnection when disconnected before
    - Fix: Makes sure to always use the BLE scanner when required
    - Fix: Prevents reading subscribed attributes from remote if not requested and needed
    - Fix: (digitaldan) Makes sure to re-use the same callbacks and options for a re-subscription of a Paired Node
- matter.js Legacy API:
    - Deprecation: We've deprecated the hand-generated device type definitions used by the pre-0.8.0 API in DeviceTypes.ts. These device type definitions remain at Matter 1.1.
    - Removal: We removed old Scenes cluster implementation which was never fully implemented or used by any Matter controller
- matter.js-react-native:
    - Feature: Introduces new package to provides a React Native compatible platform Implementations for Matter.js. This package is still in development and not fully working and should be considered experimental for now! Currently it tries to support UDP, BLE, AsyncStorage, and Crypto platform features. See [README](./packages/react-native/README.md) for more information.
